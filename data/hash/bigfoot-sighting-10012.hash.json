  "observed": "My wife and myself were trucking in 1988 . We stopped on I-90 just west of Post Falls, Idaho. I was very tired. I did my paperwork and I needed to step out. I walked around my truck and relieved myself. I did not near anything, but I got a feeling and looked to my left.  I saw it  face to face. He was no more than 10 feet from me . I cannot tell you how I felt. He was a giant.  My wife and I could have both died if he would have been angry.  I think he was there to see us.  I went back slowly into my truck and left. Before I left we heard him run back into the forest. He broke limbs like they were nothing.",
