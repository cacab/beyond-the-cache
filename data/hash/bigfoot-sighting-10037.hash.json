  "date": "2004-12-22",
  "observed": "I believe it was a saturday morning, late summer of 80-81 I don't recall the year exactly, I was 8 or 9 years old been awhile. however the incident is very vivid.... I was in the garage that morning smashing some aluminum cans. When I heard my dog barking rather franticaly. I stood up and went to the back door of the garage, and called out to quiet him down. That is when I observed him turn tail and head into his dog  house. The sound is what struck me first, I comepare it to the sound of a galloping horse...per say or at least something very heavy running paralell to where I was standing. It's like you coould fell the vibrations throught the dry ground. About 6 or 7 rows back in the cornfield I saw a rather large humanoid, roughly 7' or so I compare it to the height of the corn. Very bulky looking, It had redish brown hair and glanced at me for just a moment. It was in dead run, this whole incident lasted all of maybe 20 seconds. It was coming from the east heading roughly west, southwest. I remember the swinging of the arms out in front of itself like it was pushing it's way through the corn. once it reached the ditch line it jump from the field it was in trying to make it to the next field. But fell short roughly a few feet. I don't recall how wide the ditch was. But I could show the location. It never looked back and disappeared into the brush. Of course I was petrified took me a few moments to gain my composure and snap out of it. I ran to tell my mother what I saw but she did not believe me...never played back there again.",
