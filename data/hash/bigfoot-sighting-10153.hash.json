  "date": "2005-01-23",
  "observed": "I was driving home from a girlfriends house in the early hours of the morning on a late summer night. Patches of ground fog were scattered about over the fields. As I drove up to a ninety degree turn in the road my headlight shown on a figure in a bean field that boardered a corn field. The headlights caused the eyes to shine red and I could make out the shape of a large figure. It was standing in an area of the fog and its head and upper body were above the fog. It was as tall as the corn in the field next to it. Since the figure was next to the corn field (standing in the beans) it gave frame of referance for height.  It was as tall as the corn which in Indiana at that time of the year is at least seven to eight feet tall. I could not make out facial features or hair because of the fog and the fact that it was at least twenty yards into the field. I turned at the curve and punched the gas. My hair was standing up on my arms and head and it really scared me. I was by myself so I was not about to hang around. I did not tell anyone as I thought that I would be ridiculed.",
