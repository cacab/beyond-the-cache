  "title": "Motorists have nighttime sighting near Pulaski.",
  "date": "1989-11-15",
  "observed": "We were in the car heading back home (probably around 10:00 pm) when the sighting occurred. We were traveling east down US 64. There were high winds and my dad had trouble keeping the car on the road. We were driving along when we spotted something run across the road in front of us. It appeared to look like a bear, only more human features, but the rate at which it ran across the road made us believe it could not have been a bear. My dad (who has since passed away in 2002) and I are the only ones in the car who were able to spot what we believe was a bigfoot. My mother was in the car and looked down for a moment and missed what we saw. It happened so fast. The one thing I can remember is the bigfoot was searching for shelter quickly with the storm approaching. I could see that the bigfoot was fearful of the storm and was looking for shelter. It was one of the most unbelievable things I have ever witnessed. I have shared my story with friends and family for years. I believe I saw a bigfoot in the flesh to this day. It was amazing!",
