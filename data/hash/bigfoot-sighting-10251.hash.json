  "observed": "I was at our hunting cabin along with my dad, uncle and brother. My brother and I were sitting out in front of our cabin in front of a small campfire. My dad and uncle were inside of the cabin. It was about 10:00 at night and my brother and I heard a noise that neither one of us has ever heard before. We grew up in the country and spent alot of time in the woods, even sleeping out with buddies when we were younger.Whatever it was was in the woods about 30 yards from us and it was screaming loudly and you could hear it breaking pretty good sized limbs. This went on for about 30 seconds or so, long enough for us to hustle to the cabin. I yelled for my dad and he came out on the porch and heard it as well. He said it was something he never heard either. We have combined 70 plus years hunting between us and none of us ever heard anything remotly like this before. It almost seemed like whatever it was was very unhappy that we were there.",
