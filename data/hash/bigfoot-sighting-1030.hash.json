  "date": "1973-08-23",
  "observed": "I was a child in Fort Myers Fla., approximately 1973 or 74. We lived in a trailer court, Twin Lakes Estates. All around the perimeter of the trailer court was a canal and beyond the canal was wooded areas. In one area, we had a play ground. The play ground was separated from the woods by a dry canal. We would wonder through the woods and play war around the scrub palms. One evening it was just getting dusk, we had finished playing in the woods and were hanging around the playground. When one of the other kids said he saw something moving in the woods. We all climbed the ladder to the slide, to see further into the woods. I could just make out a shape, it was large, grey or brown covered in hair. It was moving slowly through the scrub palms we had been playing in, moving away from us. We, being just kids, freaked out and ran home to tell our parents. Only to be shushed and told it was our imaginations.",
