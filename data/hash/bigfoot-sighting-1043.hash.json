  "observed": "We lived in Mill A which is a settlement near Willard, Washington, at the edge of Gifford Pinchot forest in the 50's.My husband was in fisheries research. One day our 7 year old daughter and two of the forester's girls were playing in the schoolyard and saw a figure watching them.  They were so astonished, and afraid, they ran home, but our daughter said \"But I knew it wasn't a bear, he had such kind eyes\". Later I took census both \"farm\" and national census in Skamania county, and when I visited with some of the recluses back in the woods, they all believed in Sasquach, one showed me rabbit pens that had latches opened that no other animal could have done, and said their aggressive, very dangerous dogs actually howled to get into the house (these were not house pets).",
