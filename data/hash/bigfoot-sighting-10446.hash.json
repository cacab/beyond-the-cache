  "observed": "I work up to 2 a.m. in the morning.  I drive home on Hwy K that goes threw some good wooded area near Hatfield WI.  Anyway there are some sharp turns and you can't drive too fast on this Highway.  As I was coming down the road I saw a dark figure half in the road crossing into the other lane.  My head lights had hit about half way up it's body.  I first thought it could be a deer, but deers are light brown and this was a dark brown.  It was walking upright.  On two legs.  As my van was getting closer the head lights was moving up it's body I could see more that it was walking.  Now it was in the ditch and went into the tree line.  As I said it was 2:15 at night and I was alone.  I wasn't going to stop or slow down.",
