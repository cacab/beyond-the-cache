  "observed": "It was September of 1997 and I was outside on my back porch having a smoke.  It was about 9 o clock at night and it was a bright clear night out.  I had been out on my porch for about 2 mins when from my neighbors yard (About 30 yard away) I heard a high pitched screech (identical to your 1978 recording from Washington) I turned to my left and I saw a very big white human form running through their yard.  It was about 8-9 foot tall.  It was white in color.  I could see it running with its head turned in my direction.  I couldn't see its face but I could see the darker outline of it.  I watched it run into my woods.  I heard it running through my woods for about 10-15 secs before I hurried inside.",
