  "observed": "I was 17 and on a back packing trip with my family in Grizzly Creek canyon. It was night and we were sitting around the campfire talking.  Suddenly a foul smell came into the camp site. Smelled like a combination of rotten meat, body odor and musk.  Our dogs went crazy barking and growling staring past our campfire behind the tent.  We could not see anything.  Suddenly we heard extremely loud, and extremley close vocalizations coming from just outside the ring of light made by our fire.  The sound was unlike anything we have heard before.  It was NOT a mountain lion or an elk.  It is hard to describe the sound. It was gutteral and it undulated sounding like something was strangling a goat.  It vocalized 2 or 3 times each time the sound started slow and then built in intensity.  My dad grabbed his gun but didn't fire.  After a few more minutes the smell disapated and the dogs calmed down.  I have never been more frightened in my life, and remember wondering if I would live through the night.  The next morning we expolored the area where we felt the sounds were coming from.  There was an area of smashed grass behind a large boulder approximately 15 -20 ft from our tent but nothing else significant.",
