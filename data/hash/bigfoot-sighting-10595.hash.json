  "title": "Family has early morning encounter at small bridge",
  "date": "2005-02-10",
  "observed": "My family and I were driving home early in the morning between 2 and 3 A.M. We took a shortcut down HW 63 which runs between Haleyville,Ok and Kiowa, Ok. The Highway now is paved, but at the time of our encounter it was a well maintained dirt road. The road had many curves and hills. We were traveling around 40-50 mph. We crossed over a hill and right below the hill was a small bridge. On this bridge was a creature that was standing to the right of our pickup as we passed by. The creature was between 6-7 ft. tall and had brown shaggy hair all over it similar to an irish setter dog. As we passed, I looked at the creature right in the face. His face resembled that of an old man's. More human than apelike. I could see that the creature's face had wrinkles and very little hair around it's eyes and nose. The creature had no neck and it looked as if his head was just plopped up on his shoulders. I felt like we surprised the creature and once he finally saw us, he had nowhere to go. I remember seeing him stand real stiff against the bridge's railing as we passed. I asked my mother to turn around and see if we could get a better look at this mysterious creature. She replied\"No way!!\" I asked her what she thought we saw, she replied\"I guess it was a bear.\" I felt that it looked more like a man. She said that it was way to big to be a man. At the time of this incident, I had never heard of such thing as a bigfoot or sasquatch. Although we only got a quick glimpse of this creature, it couldn't have been an illusion. We all felt that we saw the same thing.",
