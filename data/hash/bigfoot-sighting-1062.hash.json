  "observed": "Saw a sasquatch looking through our cabin door. I was looking out at him/her. This happened when I was very young and it sounds incredible, but it happened. This occured at 9:00pm-10:00pm, during the month of July, in 1977 or 1978. There was a total of one witness. I am twenty three years old now. Said incident occured when I was approximately five or six years old. I feel I have good reason to believe strongly in my story. There is no explanation, other than this memory, of why I've spent so much time reading about and researching the subject. Also, there's the feeling I get when I'm in the woods. Kind of like I'm not really alone. Which is not to say that I feel that there is a sasquatch in the woods wherever I go, it's just the knowledge that there is something else \"there\" in general. Please take this message seriously as I have never come across anyone with as strong a conviction on the subject as myself. I would enjoy going into greater detail about my sighting if you all feel it's worth following up.",
