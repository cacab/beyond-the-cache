  "observed": "I was Hunting for Feral pigs at the Cinnamon Ridge Hunting lodge in Erhardt, SC. We had not seen any hogs the first day so on the second day we hunted in the swamp. On the way over in the morning our guide was telling us about strange noises he had heard back in the area while hunting himself. I love to hunt in the swamps for deer and ducks and have for years. At about 5:30 pm I started hearing several great horned owls calling back and forth in the area behind me which is swamp. My stand was located on a dike between a oak ridge and the water. There was a large gator hole about 100 yrds away. As the owls started calling I heard what sounded like a noise an ape would make but very loud. The \"ooow, ooow\" sound was very quick and repetetive. All the animal noises stopped suddenly and it was very still. The wood ducks and squirrels that we feed took flight in a sudden burst of movement. After the calls none returned and the area was very quiet, even the song birds. I waited until a little before dark and walked out to meet the pick - up vehicle. I have heard several vocalizations similar to this before. Once as a teenager in Delaware while hunting the swamps around Phillips Landing in the Nanicoke Foest in southern Delaware. I could also hear something very large moving around. The second time was in Washington State while stationed there in the Navy. While walking thru the Bremerton Watershed area with my new wife. That night we were followed down the logging road by something large that stayed in the brush and would stop when we did. That was also accompanied by a foul odor and even had an 80 lbs Rottweiller cowering and we had to hold him with a leash to keep from running off.",
