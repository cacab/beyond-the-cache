  "observed": "I was at my grandparents. They lived at Canton Lake. I went down to the bottom of the hill, where they lived to smoke. I heard a loud crushing noise to my right. Keep in mind there is a cornfield in that direction, but what I saw was not a cow or bear or anything I could possibly explain. They simply don't stand on two legs. Tall, black, and very foul smelling. It must have been there when I came down the hill, I only saw it after I had been there awhile. I looked, when I heard the rustling. Standing not twenty yards from me, was something I will never forget, nor want to. There was no screaming beast [except for me]; Just a being looking at me!  I did, however notice that this \"being\" was very calm, looking at me. I on the other hand was not calm at all. It made a gesture [raising of arms] that was all I saw. I ran up the hill to my grandparents. My granddad asked me where my bike was - I told him I didn't know.",
