  "observed": "I've had two possible bigfoot encounters. The first occured in 1975 when I seven.  My family lived at Little Rock AFB. At the time there were woods behind our house and a small lake as well.  After school one day I was playing in my backyard. I looked up toward the woods and saw something squatting down next to a tree looking at me.  It was covered in black hair except on its face and had as I remember a  flattened nose and pointed head. I was stunned.  I turned and ran into my house where I told my mom that I had just seen a gorilla.  I knew that it wasn't a gorilla but that was the only thing I could think of to describe it.  My mom thought I was playing around and didn't really believe me.  When I looked back there again it was gone.",
