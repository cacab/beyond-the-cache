  "date": "2004-11-16",
  "observed": "Just after hunting hours on November 16, 2004 I started to gather my gear and got ready to climb down and head to my atv after bowhunting from my treestand when I heard several loud howls followed by a hair raising scream.  It sounded like it was several hundered yards down the valley and deeper into the woods.  Instantly I couldn't recognize what I had heard.  I have been hunting for over twenty years and logged hundreds of days in the wood in Wisconsin, Canada and out west.  I have personally heard  every known animal in Wisconsin during my outings. My immediate reaction was to leave the area, quickly. I raced out of the tree, up the valley, and out to the logging road and my atv.  I drove back to camp which was around 3.5 miles from my stand.",
