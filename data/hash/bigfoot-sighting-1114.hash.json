  "observed": "I was driving home (see details, below) with my son and daughter late at night.  Suddenly an ape crossed the road with incredible speed.  We all three saw it.  We had been talking excitedly about who knows what, all very alert, all eyes on the road, when this occurred.  Our conversation came to a complete halt.  All three of us had to process what we had just seen, we just couldn't believe our eyes.  This was an ape-like animal, about the size of a large chimpanzee, traveling across the road with what can only be described as lightening speed.  It disappeared on the other side of the road as if it had disappeared into another dimension--almost swallowed up by the night so to speak.  It was on its knuckles, more or less, the way apes run.  This was apparent to all three of us, we are all fairly intelligent people with a wide variety of experience with animals.  We have lived in the woods for 20+ years in Manton in Tehama County and have all seen mountain lions, bears, racoons, otters, fisher, ringtails, raccoons, etc. and this was nothing like any of those animals.  We all three had the same experience, we all three agreed that what we had just seen had to be some kind of primate.  And we all three had never seen anything move like that before in our lives.  After some discussion we agreed that it might be a young Sasquatch.  In the days ahead I got some literature about Bigfoot at the library, and we have determined that it may very well have been a Bigfoot sighting.",
