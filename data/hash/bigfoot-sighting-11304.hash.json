  "observed": "While we were tent camping at Waldo Lake in the Oregon Cascades, at about 4 am we heard a moaning howl. My wife woke me up and said that there was a bear in the camp. I heard the howl and had no idea what kind of animal made that noise. Another camper a few hundred feet away had dogs that starting going crazy barking. The howling went on for about 20 minutes to a half hour. Our German shepherd started growling. We got up and got in the car with our sleeping bags still thinking it was a bear. At about 5 am and still dark, the other camper left in a hurry in his pickup. It looked like he lit about a half gallon of Coleman fuel in his fire pit. The flames were probably 6 feet tall. We did not see or hear anything else that night. The next day I walked around and looked for signs of the animal. I walked around the other camp and did not see anything. We joked about bigfoot coming that night but I was shocked this last year when I was listening to some of the bigfoot recordings on this site and then heard the moan howl from Columbiana, OH. That was exactly what we heard and it gave me chills.",
