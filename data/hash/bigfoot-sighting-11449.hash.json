  "observed": "It was about 10 years ago when my girlfriend and I and two of our friends went to Gold Beach, Oregon where I was going to propose to her. We got a motel across the highway from the beach. That night we went to the beach and built a campfire and I noticed footprints in the sand. What struck meas  odd was the fact that these were very deep (about 6-8 inches), very long (about 18 inches) and the stride was very long; I had to leap into each one. We followed the prints which went up a five foot embankment and disappeared. None of our group particularly believe in Bigfoot but do not totally rule it out. Just thought I would share our little story.",
