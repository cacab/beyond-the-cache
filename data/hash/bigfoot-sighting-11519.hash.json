  "observed": "My friend and I went target shooting one day in the hills east of Arcata Ca in the Spring of 94.  The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn't think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location.",
