  "title": "Possible vocalizations heard by campers at Riggs Lake, Coronado National Forest near Mt Graham",
  "date": "1997-06-10",
  "observed": "Camping in small pop-up trailer, my wife woke to the sounds of what she thought to be a heavy-set man laughing, she thought it was just another camper, but the sounds turned into some sort of crazy psycho laughing, then she got scared. In the morning she asked me if I heard the noise, I did not. I told her it was just a couple of critters fighting or something. Then a few months or so go by and I was watching a show about bigfoot, on the show they played a recording taken by a hunter, as they played it, my wife comes from the kitchen, white as a ghost and says \"That's what I heard on Mt. Graham\". So now I know it was not some small critter, and we just stored it away. A few months ago we got our first computer, going to your site I see another in the same area. Just wanted to run this by you to see if it can help.",
