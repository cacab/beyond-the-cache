  "observed": "It was 1978 or 79 in mid-summer early fall.A friend and I were in the woods behind my house, which was located on Weems Creek in Admiral Heights, when we saw a 8 or 9 foot tall hunched figure completely covered in hair in the reeds maybe 300 feet away.We watched it for maybe 20 seconds before it saw us,stood and took off for the woods.At the time we werent sure what we saw but we knew there had been sightings of bigfoot in the area.At the time I was 11 or12 years old and I never told anybody until a couple years ago but I remember it very clearly.What struck me at the time was how quickly it could run through the marshy area we saw it in , even as light as we were as kids we sunk to our knees but it didnt slow it down a bit.Whenever you mention Bigfoot people automatically think its a hoax, but there is no way on earth a man in a hairy suit could get out of that mud.",
