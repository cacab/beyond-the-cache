Guess we were about 30 miles from Flagstaff. Nearest Town Mormon Lake Nearest Road FR124 east off of Lake Mary Rd. Narrative Observed   My wife and I were camped along FR 124 Sun. afternoon through Tues. morning. Monday night, Memorial Day PM, at 7:30 I went for a walk heading east on FR 124 to maybe see some elk before dark. I went at least 1/4 mile and heard a coyote sound off. I stopped to listen and a whole chorus of coyotes joined in for about 4 seconds and stopped as quickly as they started. I would guess they were 1/4 to 1/2 mile southeast of me. A second or so after that I heard an \"AH,OO\" just as distant or even further away in the same direction. I thought someone was calling back to the coyotes but what an odd sound for a person to make, then there was another just the same as the first. I turned back to camp and wondered about these two calls as I walked  I didnâ€™t stop to listen again as it was getting dark and I wanted to get back to camp. At 8:15 I was back and I sat outside our trailer to listen again. Just I sat down I heart the \"AH,OO\" again from the same direction  followed by a high pitch \"WOW\" sound then another and then one more \"AH,OO\". So there were four \"AH,OO\" and two \"WOW\" sounds all together, that I heard anyway. The \"AH,OO\" was a mid pitch for a male person, The AH was about 1 1/2 seconds with OO short and slightly lower pitch. The WOW was very high pitch and lasted about 3 seconds. Both of these calls just started and ended without fading in or out and without waver. I listen until 9 PM without any more calls then went in to sleep. The calls were not real loud, if I was walking on the gravel road rather than stopped I might have missed them, but they were bit enough to carry over the sound of the breeze in the trees which was coming from the west. I was hesitant to report this since it was just sounds, but , rather odd sounds for a person or any animal I know of. Also I thought the time, date, location, and type of sounds may be worth reporting for past or future incidents. Thank you for the opportunity to record this.",
