  "observed": "I was just out snake hunting the roads and I saw a spot and thought I would go up and look for some snakes. I heard like a rustling, kind of like something was futher in front of me.  There was a tree line there and it breaks off into an opening. Right outside of the tree line I saw the back half from the waist up of this bigfoot. It turned ever so slightly, it didn't face me, but it turned towards my direction a little bit kind of like it acknowledged me there and then continued to walk off.",
