  "observed": "I was gathering cut firewood on my grandmothers land in southern Maine. I heard a noise behind me and turned around expecting to see a moose as I was in moose country. At first I saw nothing and resumed my gathering, again I heard the noise, I turned to look and there it was about 30 feet behind me. Male or female I do not know. It was just standing ther watching me, needless to say, I split. This happened in the summer of 1985.",
