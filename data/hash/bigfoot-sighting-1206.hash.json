  "observed": "Large tracks spotted, too large to be human, estimated size: 20 in. foot size- occurred september 23 , 1997 at 10:30 am- that night we heard loud, piercing screams in the forest and a strange odor- like a cross between a skunk and sweat- I activated my personal alarm, which apparently frightened the creature away-the next morning, we observed more tracks near our campsite- and some broken branches- needless to say I was a little frightened..",
