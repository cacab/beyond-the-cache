  "observed": "I was 10 yrs old roughly my dad and cousin and I were fishing on the Kansas River west of Topeka between Topeka and Silverlake. I was about 125 yards away from them on a sand bar when I looked to the west of me and saw a large dark hairy figure in the water splashing itself as if where bathing. I froze for a minute then it looked at me and stood there. I took off running back to my dad and cousin scared out of my wits. Finally my dad was spooked too so we left the area. To me it looked like a big bear in the water but I remember its arms were way to long.",
