  "observed": "I will tell you about my visual incident. I was walking in the woods behind my old place when I heard some noise. At first I thought it was a deer or something so I looked to see what it was. When I looked I seen its face, it was one of the scariest things I had ever seen, but at the same moment it was interesting. As soon as it looked at me it then walked off. I ran as fast as I could back home. But I do not even remember my feet touching the ground. Now I am going to tell you about what it looked like. It was about 8-9 feet tall - an educated guess. Its fur was a dark color, a cross between a brown and black with a tint of red to it.  Its face was like a cross between an ape and a man. The nose was ape-like, the skull was sort of like a gorrillas and had the look of a man's structure in the face.  It was greatly built in body and muscle mass. Later me and my friend tried to get a plaster cast of one of the foot prints but it did not work.  But we got photos of the foot prints and stuff. Right now towards winter is the best time to see them because they are easy to find and see.",

  "location_details": "It is near the old liberty park swimming pool on waterdam road. Go up it. There are several places. I would take you there because it is where I used to live and the woods are complicated. I know them very very well so get a hold of me.  I will show you and I have some proof, so does my grandma and my friend."
