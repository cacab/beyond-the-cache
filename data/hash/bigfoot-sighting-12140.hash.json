  "observed": "I have told my story to very few people for the fact that all they do is laugh. I saw a bigfoot in the summer of 1979 just east of Seneca. I lived there for about 15 years just north of the river bridge. I was 15 years old at the time and I was coming home from Morris with a friend.  We had pulled off the side of the road. My friend was outside the vehicle when we heard this horrible noise like a shrieking growl and before we knew it we saw a large human-like animal coming towards the car. I began screaming get in the car locked my door and we took off ending up doing about 90 mph fleeing. When I got home I was so terrified, that feeling has never left me. My family that was at my house when I arrived home has ridiculed me to this day and I do not travel that road for any reason any longer.",
