  "observed": "Camped at Jackass Meadow just below Florence Lake.  I was tired from a long day of fishing and driving to Lake Edison, so I ate and fished a little more and retired for the evening.  It was a full moon out and everything was really calm for a campground.  I went to bed in my tent fairly early and woke up several times during the evening.  Every thing was quiet and I got up to store my food in the bearboxes around camp.  I didn't hear anything or see any thing when I was awake.  I went back to bed and nodded off.  I awoke again from my sleep to a noise that I had never heard in the mountains.  It was late, and everyone to my knowledge was asleep.  The noise was coming from the east of the campground i'd say approx. 1/2 a mile to a mile.  I would say that it sounded the same as someone blowing through a conch shell mixed with and large mammal of some sorts.  I heard the noise two times after I awoke in five second intervals, right after one another, and then silence.  It was fairly loud and I knew that it was off in the distance because there was no other noise in the woods.  I have been camping/hiking/and mountaineering all over the West Coast and I have never heard anything like that sound.",
