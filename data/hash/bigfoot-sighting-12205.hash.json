  "observed": "On July 9th we were driving from NYC through the Carolinas for a vacation with family members. While driving on 95 I missed my exit and continued on 95 til south of the border. We weren't sure if we missed our exit so we got off the highway and went to a gas station to ask for directions. I was told to take Rte 301 off 95. This is in South Carolina. While on 301, about 10 minutes into it, I was driving at about 70-75 miles an hour when out of the dark, a black, hairy, tall thing crossed the road in front of us. It was not a bear.  It stood like a person with a slight bent. It had hair all over its body. I had to turn the wheel to the left to avoid hitting this thing.  It almost hit the right side of my van. The screams inside my car were frightening. We almost lost control of our car. I saw it, so did my wife, 2 aunts and my 7 seven year old granddaughter. It happened at about 12:30-12:45am, July 9th.",
