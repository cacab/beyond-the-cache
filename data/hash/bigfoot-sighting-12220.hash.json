  "observed": "Somehow I was fortunate enough to stumble onto this website.  I can only give you sketchy details about this incident. My brother lived on a dairy farm between Calcutta and East Liverpool. He was sitting in his home with his infant son shortly after dark when his Doberman began to bark and whine. He went to investigate. The dog would not come out of the doghouse and continued to cry out. My brother got a gun and turned out the lights in the mobile home. He sat listening and waiting, thinking there was a prowler on the property. He waited for while. Then a tall figure approached the window of the trailer. It was breathing heavily. My brother was so stunned he froze in his chair. Eventually the thing walked away. The following morning my brother found what seemed to be paths of broken down brush leading toward the creek bottom.",
