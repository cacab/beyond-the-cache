About 2:00 in the, morning, this loud howl of immense volume, coming from one the meadows, yes it did have sad tone to it, but did not seem threatening. We got into the jeep, and started spot-lighting the meadows. After hour of this, the loud howl went away. We re-treated to our camp, for some un-nerving sleep. But ever sence this encounter, our group looks for signs, of this big creature, up on south fork of the Kern River. Then ten years later what happen to bridge builders, 3 miles from our encounter. Monache Meadows is at 8,000 ft. High, and very cold at night. The south fork of the Kern River runs thru--it It has lots of deer, bear, cougars, fish and now bigfoot.",
