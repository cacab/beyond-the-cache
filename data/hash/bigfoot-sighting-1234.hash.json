  "observed": "A large brownish creature, very tall, was first heard and then seen to run across the road, down the ditch and the leap over a fence and run off into a cornfield. The next day I went back and checked the road and cornfield and found large smudged footprints. Upon commenting about this to some elderly residents I was informed that this creature or creatures has been in the area for better than 100 years from old reports of them and intermitent cattle and sheep mutilations. Creature had a foul smell to it. This occurred in the summer of 1970. Sorry I'm so late, but I didn't know where to report this besides I didn't want to be branded as crazy.",
