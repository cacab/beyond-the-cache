  "observed": "I was standing on the front deck of my girlfriend's summer home, looking down at Eleven Mile Reservoir., when I heard the sound of an animal calling. It was all most human in nature, but unlike any sound I have ever heard in my life. It was spine- tingling. I can not describe it. It lasted about 3 or 4 minutes. It sounded lost or was looking for an offspring. I am 65 an have spent a lot of time hiking & camping over the years an never have heard a sound even close to the one I heard this fall.",
