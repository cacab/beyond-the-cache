  "date": "2003-06-18",
  "observed": "I did not directly see this incident.  I don't even know if this IS a sighting!  We were on our way to Alaska in 2003 and went via Glacier National Park.  I had a video camera that I was recording on and took more videos than photos.  Only months after we got back home and I got around to looking at the tapes, did I see this figure in the video.  I wish I had seen it while I was filming.",
  "classification": "Class B",
  "county": "Glacier",

  "location": "-113.82,48.68",
  "location_details": "This was on the main road (Going To The Sun Highway) into Glacier National Park from Missoula, Montana - the western side of the park. I know this bridge was a little way after the first big lake (Lake McDonald). One could walk down in to the park and one had to walk down a narrow little dirt path to get to the bridge that went over the river which is on the left side of the road."
