  "date": "2001-01-04",
  "observed": "well it was really dark outside and i could not make a good visual of the creature but it was unlike anything i have ever seen before in my life.  If was about 8ft tall and i would say about 450 pounds.  it was walking like a human kinda but not exactly.  It was very hairy looking and was making some weird grunting noises.  Then when it saw me i about **** my pants i was so scared i thought about running but i was too scared to run so i stayed and then it left i was so relieved. There is such a thing as bigfoot i took pictures of his foot prints in the mud and i think that they should send researchers out here to look for it i believe that you will find it actually i promise you will find it.",

  "location_details": "Start at Raceland Super Quik \"Gas Station\" on US23 and head towards Greenup until you get to the caution lights on the highway.  Then you will see on the left about 1 mile up the road a set of gates on the left.  It used to be addingtons landfill.  But now it is abandoned and there is just alot of forest back there now.  After you go through the gates you stay on the main road which is blakctoped and you stay on that road for about 2 miles and then it turns to gravel.  Follow the gravel road until you come to another set of gates and go through them. Stay on the gravel for about 2 miles then there is a dirt road to the left follow it to pine thicket and then you go up this real steep hill and that is the area where i saw bigfoot."
