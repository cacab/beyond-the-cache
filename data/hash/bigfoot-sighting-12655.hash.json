  "title": "Possible tracks and vocalizations outside Ashford",
  "date": "2005-11-02",
  "observed": "Spring of 2005 mid after noon we drove up to a place we call the Oasis (a pond on the top of one of the foot hills on Skate Creek (Mt. Rainier but I believe it is GP national forest) its a ways up there and some 4x4'n is needed to get there. When we got there and got out of the car you could hear a noise that sounded kind of like a monkey noise....ooh ooh ooh....it was repetative and I didnt think anything of it at first. So we hike up the hill side to where the noise is coming from and where the pond is, and we discovered a foot print while the whole time still hearing this noise, ooh ooh ooh, short and sharp but monkey like. At one point we felt as if it ran right up behind us as if to scare us but we didnt hear any brush crashing or anything but the noise got closer and you could actually like hear it in the back of his throat. Nothing real exciting or more than circumstantial but when we returned again a few months later the noise was not there.",

  "location_details": "Hwy 7 past Ashford, take a right before you see a sign for the national park. This road turns into Skate Creek Rd. It's a dirt road on the left.  Go right at an over pass between mile marker 12 and 14. Drive all the way up. Take a right at the first fork then stay to the left. You will need a 4x4 vehicle. 4x4 vans will not make it."
