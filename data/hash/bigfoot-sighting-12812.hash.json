  "date": "2001-09-05",
  "observed": "My son and I were delivering newspapers in the Talcott WV area. We were on a one lane road, I pulled into a driveway to deliver a paper, as I was putting it in the box, my son [23 years old] says look dad a gorilla. I turned quickly to look. It was walking in the yard of the home towards the woods. We watched it for about 30 seconds as it left our view. I told my son there are no gorillas in WV. Thats a bigfoot. It was about 7 feet tall with long arms, like a gorilla. It didn't seem to care about us at all. It just walked away. It was very hairy. We both got a real good look at it. We both got goose bumps. It was about 4 am. It was in Sept. around the 5th. in 2001. We  looked every night in that area for the next 6 months, but never saw it again.",
