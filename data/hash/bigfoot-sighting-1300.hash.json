  "observed": "I was deer hunting with a friend for whom I have known and hunted with for years. I was in my tree stand at about 9:15 am when I noticed a shape emerming from the tree's to my left, I then realized it was Scott. I notticed that there was something wrong with him because he was pale white, he was comming up the ridge extremly quick and was looking behind him at all time's. I motioned to him thinking that he might have been starteled by a big buck, but he let me know real quick that it was not so. Scott stoped at a stump to catch his breath and turned to look behind him once again at this time I became concerrd, for I have never seen him this scared. He finlly arived at my stand obviously extreamly distrubed, I climbed down from my stand and aked what was wrong. He explained to me that something which I chuckled at. He told me that something was behind him and got very disturbed with his presence, and started to stalk him in a very aggresive mannor. He then stood up to see what was walking around him ,when all of the sudden a horrible and terrifing yell shot through his body that shook him. He gathered his pack and proceeded to my stand. We talked and decided to investagate the situation due to the fact that we were camped 1\\2 of a mile away. What we found was very disturbing,trees snaped in half at 9 to 10 feet high, some very deep indindtions that were 12 to 14\" long. Normally that would be no big deal except it had not rained for some time. We followed the tracks for two miles until they went into extremly dence follage. I passed this of as the jitters but the next day I was stalked myself.",
