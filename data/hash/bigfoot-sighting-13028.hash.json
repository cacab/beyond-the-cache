  "observed": "Me and my friend Aaron were at my uncles house, we were on the back porch playing darts. We started to notice that there was a lot of meteors. We stepped into the back yard to get a better view. We were facing towards the front yard, I was looking up when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye, I looked and there was a creature around 5 foot tall running through the front yard, from left side of the yard to the right side, it was not large like most reports, it had muscle definition, black or dark brown hair, no neck ,no hair on the face, chest and stomach area, inside of the arms or palms of the hands. It was going at a slow jog, then it must of smelt or heard us. It slowed down, turning its head while slowing down. then it stopped looked at us for around 3 to 4 seconds. Then it ran towards the dark area of the yard, it ran so fast no man can run that fast. I sat there thinking what was that, I was quiet for a while, I didn't want to say anything and sound crazy, hey i just saw a Bigfoot. I looked at my friend Aaron, he had a strange look on his face and he was shaking his head,he looked at the same spot in the yard. I asked did you see something? He replied yes. I then asked did it look like it was on two legs running up right. He replied yes, then my heart really skipped a beat, not only did I just see something , but my friend did to. My uncle did not see the creature, he said yaw didn't see anything yaw just messing with me. After that we went inside, nothing else happened, we continued to talk about what we had saw . My uncle said that we are crazy.",
