  "title": "Early evening sighting by residents on the Hillsborough River",
  "date": "1955-01-01",
  "observed": "In the mid nineteen fiftys I lived in a housing project in Tampa FL. It was called River View Terrace and it was right on the Hillsborough River next to Florida Ave. There was a movie theater on the other side of the river called the Tower Drive-in. One evening after dark, me and a buddy was watching the movie from the projects side of the river, you could not hear the sound from the movie but at least it kept me off the streets. I had moved over from Lakeland FL because my dad had been killed and my uncle was sort of keeping an eye on us, he lived near there on a street called Flora. Well anyway we were deep in watching the movie and we heard something behind us and we both turned and saw a large hariy creature between us and the last lamplight that the projects had to offer. It looked like the common version of the bigfoot stereo-type I see today but back then it just looked like the common ordinary \"boogyman \" to us. We split and never looked back.",
