  "observed": "It was in the Fall of 1991 and my sister Patty and I were watching Saturday Night Live.  I've always believed in the evidence of the Fouke Monster and have seen \"The Legend of Boggey Creek\" several times through my life.  I am the LAST person who would want to see a real-life Bigfoot.  Anyway, we were watching television and our dog Sandy began to bark a whole bunch.  There weren't many cars that went down our road that late in the evening (around 1 a.m.) and both Patty and I began to wonder what was going on.  We opened the door and both saw a large and dark figure standing down by the mailbox (around 1/4 of a mile from the house) and we both kind of freaked.  It was humped over and I began to instantly think of Boggey Creek and Travis Crabtree's story.  We went to our parents' room and woke them to see if they had a flashlight.  When we finally did find one \"it\" was gone.  I didn't sleep very well for a few night in fear that whatever that thing was would come back.  Fortunately we didn't hear or see anymore.  I did check out the road that night but never thought to look for footprints the next day;  probably from fear of what I would find!!!!",
