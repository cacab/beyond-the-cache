  "date": "2005-11-25",
  "observed": "It was about 11pm and we just laid down to sleep. We were staying in a cabin that we had rented for the weekend. I heard this high pitched horrific scream/howl. It was close. It was not some faint, distant sound. It was very clear and close. My first thought was a woman in distress. Then, about 20 seconds later, I heard it again. I also heard dogs barking above me, higher up the ridge. This time I realized it was probably not a human. This sound was a forceful, deliberate, high pitched reverberating scream/howl. Because I was inside the cabin, it is hard to tell how far away this was. I would guess within 750 feet. Perhaps as close as 200 feet. The scream/howl continued about four/five more times, repeating about every 15-25 seconds. I have military and hunting experience and have never heard such a sound. I cannot think of an animal that could make this type of sound. I will never forget it, that's for sure.",
