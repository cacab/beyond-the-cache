  "observed": "I was coming home after work about 9:30 to 10 pm heading north on ridge road.  It recently rained. Something rain across the road on two legs.  It was about 50 to 100 yards away.  It appeared to be about as tall as the hood of my car. It stopped momentarily as my headlight hit, and looked at my car, and then it turned and continued to cross the road and disappeared into the woods. I was thinking, \"what the hell was that?\" I live  nearby and hunt throughout the surrounding woods. I know it wasn't a bear or any thing we normally see in the area.",
