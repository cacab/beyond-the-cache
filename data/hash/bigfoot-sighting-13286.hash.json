  "date": "2005-12-15",
  "observed": "I was gathering some firewood from a stack of previously split wood behind my house. I kept hearing a strange \"whooping\" sound coming from the thick woods about 100 yards away. My nearest neighbor has horses which I could hear bolting away about the same time. My dog ran to the edge of the woods and kept barking and running around back and forth in that area. I have never heard these kind of sounds before. It was after dark about 9:00 pm. I also could faintly smell a very odd smell. Strangly enough the smell reminded me of a zoo. The incident lasted about one or two minutes. I believe that I was being watched.",
