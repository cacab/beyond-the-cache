  "date": "2005-07-15",
  "observed": "Part of my travel route to work is along Kentucky State Route 164 from Kentucky State Route 807 to U.S. Route 68 at Canton, KY in Trigg County.  I was driving along jamming on the radio, but looking for deer.  Deer are constantly running out in front of vehicles and causing accidents.  So I try to stay alert for the deer.  On this day I saw much more that I bargained for.  There on the side of the road in the edge of the woods was a bigfoot.  It was just standing there watching me drive by.  It did not seem violent or mean spirited.  It was at least 10 feet tall and covered with thick black hair.  I've watched for it every since then and have yet to see it again.",
