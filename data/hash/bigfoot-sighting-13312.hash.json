  "observed": "I was out for a ride on road bicycle and had to stop on the side of the road to take a nature break. The section of road where I took my break had woods on both sides of the road. The right side of the road where I was stopped at was at the base of a banked hill. The opposite side of the road dropped down into a valley where a creek ran through it. There were no houses close in the area, and I was really out in the country. As I was taking my break all the sudden this rock goes flying across the road in the air about 15 ft off to my right shoulder. I just caught it going through the air out of the corner of my eye. I turned just in time to look across the road and see it land on the other side of the road. I looked up the hill to see who could have been throwing it, but could not see anyone. The hill had a very steep slope to it and most of the leaves had fallen off the trees, so it was easy to see deep into the woods. Getting a weird feeling I finished my business, and got back on the pedals and left the area. I heard no sounds, nor did I did smell any orders. But the location I was at no one could have seen me coming and climb this hill fast enough to get out of my line of sight. of sight.",
