John Mark Breeze, while returning from jogging around 10:30 p.m., heard a noise in the bushes, ran up the hill to his house, turned around and saw a bigfoot running along the road. The bigfoot went over a barbed wire fence without much effort and disappeared into a field. Later Deputy Dwight Posey found an track one and a half feet long, seven inches wide, and shaped like a foot. It was too deep in the gravel for him to duplicate with his shoes. John said the creature was between 6-8 feet tall, had a 3 foot shoulder span, no neck, and dangling arms.",
