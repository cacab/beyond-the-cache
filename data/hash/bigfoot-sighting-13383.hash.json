  "observed": "Guided elk hunting trip in bowls creek, deer lodge anaconda pintlers. Coming down a game trail on a ridge in deep dark timber. My horse was tired. All of a sudden he became nervous. A little breeze coming to me. Went about 75 yards and my horse started looking to the left.  About 25 to 30 feet there was a big root ball from a downed pine tree from the waist up crouching down was a bigfoot. I looked at him in the eyes, it was surprised as I. It was not an ape it looked more like a man but it had hair all over about 6 to 8 inches long. I had a rifle but I was so close to it I was afraid to make any sudden moves other than just keep riding. I will never forget and some day if funds are available I would like to make an effort to find it again.",
