  "observed": "This may take a while, I don't type very fast. It was in the early autumn,while I was burning feed sacks out behind the bunk house. The sacks were damp so I tossed a cup of gas on the still small flame and it made a roaring sound and flames shot up in the air about 5 feet. It was immediately after that, I heard a noise behind me. It can best be described as a (gasp/startled) sound and limbs breaking. I turned quickly and saw a very tall, maybe 7 feet, reddish-brown bigfoot running back into the woods. As I said it was tall, rather lean looking, barrel chested, no neck. The head, from the side view seemed to be slightly pointed, but that could have been a trick of the light. It had a slim waist, compared to the size of the chest. It had a very long stride, for it didn't take 5 to 10 seconds before it was in the thick woods and I lost sight of it. I waited until the fire was going good, went and got my gun, I wasn't aiming to shoot it, I just felt safer with the gun, and I went out to where I saw it and found no tracks, because of the thick leaves and ground clutter. At the time forest was virgin and could not pick up a trail. Earlier that year, late summer, something broke a big limb, about 4\" in diameter, off a sweetgum tree not 15 feet from where I burned the feed sacks. But this was done at night and no one saw or heard anything.",
