Traffic was backed up due to snow and ice on the highway bringing traffic to a standstill after stepping out of the vehicle we saw a woman pointing up onto the hillside. We observed the creature about two hundred feet above the highway on a ridge-line ofver looking the road. Due to the snow and ice and the fear of everyone around we were not able to follow the creature.
