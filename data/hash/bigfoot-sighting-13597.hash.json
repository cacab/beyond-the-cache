  "observed": "I stepped outside to empty the trash when I heard at first what sounded like a siren.  It could best be described as sounding similar to the whoops posted on this site.  There were 4 or 5 loud whoops that had more emphasis towards the end of the sound.  Immediately following the first sound and continuing throughout the sounds I could here a pack of coyotes going absolutely nuts.  There are a lot of coyotes that frequent the area so I know their sounds really well.  Sometimes they get worked up but never anything like this. After the sounds ended everything went quiet, even the coyotes stopped howling.",
