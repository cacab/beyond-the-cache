  "observed": "I was at work with my uncle. Its a family business, and it is located near the forest, with a huge open field across the creek. Anyways, we weren't very busy at work, so my uncle is walkin around and looks out the back door, he stops, and yells to me, HEY COME HERE!  So i run over to where he's standing and see this big black hairy thing running down the hill. It definatly wasn't a bear, a bear can't run down a hill on 2 feet.  This thing was very big and hairy like an ape, and it moved very very fast.",
