  "date": "1986-06-01",
  "observed": "In the summer of 1986 my brother and myself where driving home from Paris on Hwy 22. I was driving and my brother had fallen asleep. I was driving east just about 1/4 of a mile east of skating rink road. I was watching the roadway when a large reddish brown animal ran in front of my car. I barely missed the creature. I clearly saw that it was on two legs and had long fur as we went by. I slammed on my brakes and screamed out when I had first saw it. My brother startled awake and I asked him if he had seen that. He did not. I looked in my rear view mirror but did not see the creature anymore. I have had several animals run in front of my car from horses, cows, deer and once a pig. I played over what I had seen over and over and realized that it wasnâ€™t any animal I had ever seen before. I know it was huge bigger than a man.",
