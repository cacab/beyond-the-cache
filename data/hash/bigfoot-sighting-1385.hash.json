  "observed": "A friend and I were hiking up to Franklin Falls on a warm, late afternoon in August. The woods were pretty quiet with just the sound of the river and the distant sound of traffic from the interstate. As far as I know, we were alone on the trail though it's a popular one. We were walking along talking and all of a sudden there was a high, throaty, wailing scream (or rather three or four of them) that echoed off the mountainsides and made the hair stand up on the backs of our necks. We were both raised in Washington and have spent a lot of time in the woods, heard the sounds that a lot of different kinds of widlife make and agreed that neither of us had ever heard anything like that before. It didn't sound like the source was really close but the volume was incredible and with the screams bouncing off of the hills around us, it wasn't possible to judge the distance. It was a scary sound and un-nerved us so badly that we turned around and went back to our car and drove away. I don't know if it was just fright or what but we felt watched all the way. I will never forget that sound and the closest thing I've heard is the recordings that supposedly are the sounds of the Sasquatch. The memory of it still raises goosebumps and makes the hair at the back of my neck tingle. We've only told a few friends about this and I must admit feeling a little odd telling it now.",
