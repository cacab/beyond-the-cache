  "observed": "One day during a hike through the woods, My father and I heard large heavy foot steps on the opposite side of a dirt mount we were standing near. We are both experienced hunters, and this sound was unmistakably made by a animal with two legs. We both stood still and listened to the footsteps walk by us. As the sound drew nearer, we became a little nervous. It was almost as though what ever was walking was going to walk right over the dirt mound that separated it from us. Suddenly, the foot steps stopped only a few feet from us. There was an incredible vibration in the air as though it sensed us, and it knew, that we knew it was there. After what seemed like 8-10 minutes it resumed walking away. \"I think I must have broken the world record, longest held breath\". \"I know we should have inspected the other side of the dirt mound for tracks or something, but the impression of fear was so overwhelming that we did not have any desire to see what is was. We only knew we wanted to get away from there quickly\". Soon after, we relaxed a little and decided to start heading home. While walking to the car, we never talked at all until we were safely in our truck. People often talk about an odor of urine, while encountering these creatures, but my recollection was a strong pungent smell of ammonia.",
