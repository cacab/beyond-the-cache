  "title": "Night time sighting by motorists on Highway 512 near Elwood (driver's observation)",
  "date": "1987-10-10",
  "observed": "In 1987, my college roommate and I were driving home from a football game where we were playing in the marching band. The time was about 11:00 p.m. on a Saturday night.  We were driving on highway 512 through a community called Elwood in Clarke County, Mississippi.  As we approached the straight stretch, just before you reach the town of Quitman, we saw a creature walk from the bushes on the right side of the highway onto the road.  It didn't see us or didn't look at us until it reached about the center line, then it paused, looked at us, and then continued on across the road and into the woods on the other side. The creature was very tall, with long arms.  It had reddish brown fur (?) all over.  When it looked at us, its eyes reflected the headlights of our car.  It walked upright, with a pretty natural gait, almost fluid in its movement.  We had been talking about the game on the way home, but when we saw whatever it was, we both stopped. I slowed down the car as I got to where it crossed and I know the hair stood up on my arms. It still does today when I tell the story again.  We knew we had witnessed something unusual that night.",
