  "title": "Late-night road-crossing sighting by firefighter near the Potomac River",
  "date": "2006-07-04",
  "observed": "It was back in probably the early 1970's, Spring time, late at night (around midnight).  I was out riding down this road that had a farm on one side and an apple orchard on the other.  As I was driving there was some movement about two hundred yards in front of me going across the roadway from the farm to the orchard.  When the object got to the middle of the road it turned its head and looked in my direction, at this time I got a real good look at it, about 8 to 9 feet tall very heavy build, long lanky arms, long dark red hair, very long stride (about two and a half steps to cross road).  If I was to guess his weight, it would have been around 4 to 5 hundred pounds.  I was on a road with very little traffic (I was the only vehicle on the road at that time).  I got to admit, I was not a bigfoot believer until that night.  I didn't tell anyone about this because I knew they would not believe me.  I was one of the chief officers in our local fire department at the time and I didn't want people to think I was nuts.  Oh by the way, I did get close enough to see what it was or wasn't.  I know I was shaken up a bit and did not travel that road for a long time afterwards.",
