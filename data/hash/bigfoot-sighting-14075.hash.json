  "observed": "It was the first week of December 2002. I was camping with my friend [edited], in Macon County, North Carolina. We had been there 2 days. We decided to take one of our usual late night walks. Because of the weather we were one of only three sites occupied. There was an icestorm on the way and we were planning to leave early the next morning. We had crossed the river and walked about 200 yards to the gates when we were startled by a scream that made the hair on my neck stand up. I have spent my entire life in the outdoors, much of it in wilderness areas and I have never heard anything like this in my life.  I was carrying my sidearm and immediately drew it and aimed my maglite in the direction of the scream. The next thing we knew,several rocks were thrown in our direction. TO say we were frightened would be an understatement. We went back to camp and left early the next morning.  Since then we have returned several times, but there have been no further incidents, although we sometimes feel uneasy in one particular area.",
