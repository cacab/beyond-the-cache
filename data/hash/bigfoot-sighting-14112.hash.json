  "title": "Afternoon sighting by motorists near Quinault Fish Hatchery",
  "date": "2004-07-29",
  "observed": "On July 29th,2004 my mother,aunt, and I were leaving the Lake Quinault Lodge after having lunch there.  We decided to take the shortcut between Neilton and the Lake Quinault park turnoff to go towards the ocean at Moclips.  About a mile from the Quinault fish hatchery we all saw something none of us believed in.  It was very tall, dark brown hair, walked on two legs like a man but resembled a gorilla, (sort of).  This was at about 2:30 in the afternoon, no rain, clear day with sunshine.  It crossed the road a few hundred feet in front of my pick-up.  When it crossed, it didn't seem to be in any hurry, glanced breifly our way and continued as if we were unimportant.  It's stride was such that it easily stepped from the road back into the brush without losing any momentum.  I stepped on the gas to try to get a better look as this thing was moving fairly good clip but didn't seem to be running but just moving right along.  I would say it was approximately 8' tall.  I say this as I am almost six feet tall and this thing towered over my truck.  This was NOT some guy in a suit, as the area is fairly isolated and not many cars go down this road.  In fact, we only saw two more cars on that road until we reached the ocean turnoff.  It was also not a bear, or at least no bear I have ever seen to walk like this did.  It was also hunched over somewhat or didn't have any neck but gave me the impression of being hunched forward somewhat.  It was not scruffy or dull colored hair but appeared to be healthy especially the way the thing moved.",
