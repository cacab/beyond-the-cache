  "date": "1985-11-01",
  "observed": " I no longer live in Lake Co. but I lived there from 1985-1999. I was working the night shift at a local hospital in Leesburg and lived out near Lake Jem area. I was on my way home about 11:15 one night and just ahead of me I saw the HUGE blackish brown creature run across the road. I slowed for a bit and it ran into the trees not far from the subdivision where I lived.  I said to myself at the time.. what was that? A bear?? Do they run upright?? I got home and mentioned it to my husband (now deceased) and he just blew it off as nothing so I never mentioned it again until he had passed away and I moved to where I live now. I was talking with a dear friend who really is into the bigfoot movement and she told me that it HAD to be a bigfoot as bears do not run upright and really I guess I knew that.  That night that I saw it, as I continued down the road and turned into my subdivision I had my car window down and I definately could smell a stench that I had never smelled before. At the time I did not know much about the bigfoot but my dear friend has since educated me and I am totally convinced , especiallly since reading this article on Lake Co. Bigfoot that I was fortunate enough to have encountered one. Thank you for your research and positive reinforcement. I can not remember if this happened late 1985 or very early in the year of  1986 but I believe it was late (oct-dec) 1985",
