  "title": "Night sighting by motorists near Garden State Parkway, exit 52",
  "date": "1998-07-15",
  "observed": "It was at approximately 9:00 - 9:30 p.m.  My mother and I were heading home from the mall in Tom's River.  I exited the Garden State Parkway and came up to the stop sign, stopped and turned left.  I had my high beams on, as this is a high deer area.  It is predominately wooded for the few miles drive into New Gretna. As I approached the overpass of the parkway, we both noticed this man-like creature standing alongside the guardrail.  My mother said, \"What the hell is that?\" I had the same thought! Here stood this man-like creature approximately 7' tall, covered with hair from head to foot.  It's head was hairy also, except for the areas surrounding the eyes, cheeks and mouth. It appeared grayish in color from the headlights. In a split second, it turned its head and looked right at us.  At the same time, it lifted its left leg over the guardrail and disappeared down into the darkness of the woods. My mother wanted me to turn around and go back,  I was too shocked and scared to. The fact we were two women alone on this dark road, was not a good idea. I did however, go back to that very same spot the next morning to see if there was anything there to prove further what we had seen.  That part of the woods was so overgrown with briars and horrible thorn bushes, nothing human could have walked thru there without being torn and shredded to pieces. To this day, each and every time I get off that exit of parkway, I slow down and look around in that area. What I saw made a believer out of both my mother and I.",
