  "observed": "When i was 14 i was camping in Wharton state forest north of Hampton furnace.I was alone.Just before dark I was out walking,I became aware that something was shadowing me back in the brush.It followed me to camp and began to circle.It was very stealthy, it circled while I cooked and got ready for the night.I finally crawled in the tent and tried to sleep.After awhile I heard a faint sound behind me, I was about to look out the back window when this thing started screaming,I have never heard anything that loud in the woods The volume was like a car horn up close.people tell me it was an owl,well I have heard alot of owls and they can't even come close. I lay there for a long time to scared to move,I thought I heard it moving closer and I started screaming.It just stopped and walked off.After a very long night I packed up at first light and got out of there.The area behind the tent was covered in pine needles and I had no desire to look in the brush for tracks.",
