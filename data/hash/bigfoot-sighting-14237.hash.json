  "observed": "I think it may have been about 1966. I was stationed at Leavenworth Kansas as a guard superviser. It was during the Missouri deer hunting season. I had a Missouri Licence for deer and got up long before dawn to go deer hunting. I went across the river into Missouri long before daylight at Leavenworth. It had snowed about a inch or two between 3 and five in the morning. I went north on a gravel road on the Missouri side of the river. It was fresh snow and no tracks but mine, evan on the gravel road. There was a field a few miles north about 1/2 mile across or so that led to the woods along the river. I got there before daylight. There were no tracks from anyone or anything. It was a fresh snow, not over a couple hours old. I walked to the edge of the woods along the river and found footprints that made me look like a little kid when I put my boot in them. It was like a barefoot person with really big feet. I tracked him for a little ways. He had come out of the wood to the edge of a river bottom field and walked along the egde of the woods, then backtracked himself in the edge of the woods to where if anything were following him they would go right by him. He then bent over some smaller willows and ate the bark off off them. From there he went back into the really thick stuff along the river. I did not attempt to follow. There is no doubt in my mind that it was a bigfoot. To question what I saw would be a insult to my itelligence.",
