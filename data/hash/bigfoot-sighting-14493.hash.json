  "title": "Teen has a daylight encounter while hunting near Big Lake, Bemidji",
  "date": "1983-11-23",
  "observed": "I was deer hunting not far from my home overlooking a cedar swamp.  I noticed a black \"head\" appearing above the pine trees (the cedars were short growing a wet lowland, I'd guess they were 6-7 feet at the time)  The head would appear and disappear periodically.  My best guess was it was eating something and moving around in the lowland.  It was visible for 10 to 15 minutes.  I would estimate I was 50 to 75 yards away from the creature.  No noise and nothing else was notable.  It did not behave like a bear and I've never seen a black upright for that much time.  I was sitting on a down tree and my cousin hunting with me was probably a quarter mile away.  He didn't see or hear anything.",
