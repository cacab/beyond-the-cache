  "observed": "I heard clicking noises that I thought sounded like rocks smashing together. I continued to hike to my deer stand, paying little attention to the sounds. When I got to my stand, I heard the same sound again. I could not pinpoint the direction of the sound at that time. There is a quarry to the south and a sportsmans club to the east so I figured there was someone working on either property. Every so often, I would hear about 3-5 clicks in a row and then they would cease. This went on for about 45 minutes or so. I remember thinking it strange that in 9 years of hunting this very spot, I could not remember ever hearing these \"clicks\". I was able to locate the direction of the sound to be on the ridge bordering the State Land and the Clubs property. I turned my attention to that area, trying to scope the ridge and hillside for the source of the clicking sounds. Finding nothing up there moving and still hearing the clicking, I decided to leave and scout another location. About halfway out of the woods, I heard what sounded to me to be a large animal coming at me. In the time it took me to turn around,the thing stopped. I thought I spooked a deer. As I tried to see the source of the commotion, the thing grunted once at me! The grunt(?) was very loud and close! I still couldn't see it so I chambered a round in my .308 Ruger. As soon as I loaded, it screamed/grunted bloody murder but it didn't move. I did!! At no time did I get even a glance of it. The scream/grunt sounded gutteral and loud!  Never have I heard anything like it! Loud and agitated!!",
