  "observed": "Our family kept a bee yard near Mt. Shasta, on the old Oregon Trail.  One evening, after tending the bees, my father looked up towards the road home and saw a man standing near a stump of a tree.  Then he heard a sort of yip-yip-yipee sound, somewhere between a coyote and a cowboy roundup yell, but very loud.  Our old dog Queeny jumped into the car like she was scared.  The man-like creature took off, loping away in a slow run with it's arms sort of hanging down.  When my dad drove closer to the stump later on, he realized that by the height of the stump and the height of the man or man-like creature, that it would have had to be much larger and taller than any normal man.  We believe it was \"bigfoot.\"",
