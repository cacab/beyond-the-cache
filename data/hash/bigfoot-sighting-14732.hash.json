  "observed": "I was family camping with my wife, daughter, and father below Huntington Reservoir.  The last two nights of this trip while sitting around the fire late at night we started hearing a moaning sound that sounded like it was coming from the opposite ridge roughly 2-4 miles away.  We heard these sounds repeatedly for over an hour on both  nights and they seemed to be coming from at least two different directions.  My father and I are both avid bigfoot enthusiasts and have been to all of the locations of recent sightings in Utah posted on your site.  But, this trip we weren't even thinking about it or talking about when my father said do you hear that.           After listening for a second I heard a long moaning howl that(as far as we can tell) sounds amazingly similar to the Ohio howl.",
