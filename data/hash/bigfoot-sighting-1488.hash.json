  "observed": "I was at Flat Gap with my friend Clay in September 1999. We were throwing rocks to his dog Bonnie when she stopped chasing them and her ears rose.  Mine and Clay's hearts started pounding. I looked down the hill about 12 feet away when it jolted across the clearing. Clay said he only saw about the last second but I saw it all.  He thought it was a bear like most stupid people do but it ran on two feet like a human.  I have studied bigfoot ever since i could read.  I know it was REAL.",
