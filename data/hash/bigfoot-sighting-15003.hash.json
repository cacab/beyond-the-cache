  "observed": "There were six of driving toward shelby forest one night just after dark.  We had probably driven 5 or 6 miles from Highway 51 when I was something run accross the road in front of the car just inside for the headlight range.  At the same time I saw this the driver of the car stopped immediately and looked around at everyone in the car.  Apparently he could tell by my look I saw it too and then asked me directly if I saw \"it\".  I said yes and then we drove in reverse until there was a turnaround between the divided highway and got out of there.  To this day I am not sure what it was that I saw but it was on two feet and very fast.  Watkins extended is divided  and it crossed 4 traffic lanes and the median in just a couple of seconds.  It was very big black and looked like it was covered with fur.  It was hard to tell exactly since it was just inside the headlight range and happened very quicky.  It ran with a slight forward tilt and with very little arm bend.  No one else in the car saw it besides myself and the driver.",
