  "observed": "I was driving home from work shortly after 11pm, heading east on hwy 101 away from Port Angeles. The sighting occured about 1 mile west of the O'Brien rd. intersection. I observed a creature aprox 8 foot in height in the far view of my headlights, this creature thus did cross a four lane highway in aprox 3 or 4 very fluid and unbreaking strides at a incrediably rapid pace. As I approached closer in the brief window of observation the creature thus did turn his head in my direction as he crossed the remaining distance of the highway, he also did appear to be covered with much hair. He disapeared quickly into a field of tall dry grass bordering the highway. He was moving from a northerly direction to the south towards which the Olympic Mountains border.",
