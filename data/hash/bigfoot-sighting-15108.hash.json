  "observed": "I was getting ready for bed one night at our upper house here on Black Mountain. There was no development at this time so the woods behind that house would still be considered wilderness. We had a cat that wasn't supposed to be in the house, so when he ran inside and hid under our bunk beds I had to go and get him. I bent down to pick him up from under the bed, and as I stood back up, I looked out the window that was right in front of me. As I looked out at the starry sky I was shocked, if not terrified, to see the dark outline of a strange figure walking past the window. Because of the tree tops, I could only see the top half of the body, but I would estimate it to be at least seven feet tall. It looked very large and lofty. I knew it couldn't be anybody that was on the mountian at the time. The shape of the head was that of a man with a mullet hair cut, so you couldn't make out the contour of the back of the head, it sort of went straight down. One thing I remember thinking was strange about the way it walked --  it swung it's arms as it walked by, like pendulums.",
