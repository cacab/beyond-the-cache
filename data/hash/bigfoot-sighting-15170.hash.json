  "date": "2006-03-01",
  "observed": "We were in the car taking out our boat. I forgot which road we were on. We saw a group of people out of their car on the side of the road with cameras and binoculars out. From what i saw of the creature it was very tall, I'd say around 7-9 feet. It was very muscular, covered in dark brown fur with a patch of white in the chin area. It was just standing there (it might've been confused, I don't know). My dad thought it was a bear, i think it was too slender to be a bear. My mom (who thinks that the whole concept of cryptids is ridiculious) thought it was a deer, i don't know how because it must've had huge, furry antlers. I think i saw either Skunk Ape or Bigfoot. I've been looking at pictures of them all my life and it's what I saw.",
