  "observed": "On the night of July 8th 2006, at Malakoff Historical State Park, I heard a man sized creature run up behind me and stop. I shone my flashlight and saw a pair of eyes down hill from me but they were as tall as I. I screamed and threw my flashlight at my husband and wanted him to see for himself. There was nothing there when the men looked around and there was also no sound of a spooked animal running away. Instead we heard catious and quite footsteps heading away from our campsite. This was no bear or coyote. It was huge, at least 6 feet tall and quiet. I wish I would have stared longer, but I was freaked out. When I stumbled upon your site I was suprised that there were so many sightings in the area. If you need more detail please feel free to contact me. I am a very impatient typist.",
