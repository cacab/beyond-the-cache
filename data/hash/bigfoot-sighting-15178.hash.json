  "date": "1999-03-15",
  "observed": "We were on our way back from Las Vegas NV going around 89A over the mountian road of Jacob Lake and the North rim of the Grand Canyon. My aunt thought it would be fun to play in the snow so we pulled over, we were in a type of gorge where the road cuts threw the mountians as were playing i thought i could hear someone yelling it was loud because i heard this sound over my cousins snow fight. i guess my aunt heard the same thing because she had a weird look on her face and as we were ready to leave the area we all heard the second howl this time it was loud and clear and deep. so we high tail it out of there my aunt did not want to know what made that noise. i compared this howl to the ohio howl on your website they are exaclly the same. i believe the howl i heard was not from the local wildlife.",
