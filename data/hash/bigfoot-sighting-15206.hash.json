  "title": "Possible tracks found on Buckles Mountain",
  "date": "2005-10-06",
  "observed": "While out deer huntning myself and my wife found a set of tracks alongside Forest service road 2302. This road starts on Forest service road 406 and travels for approximately 1.5 miles before dead-ending on a hilltop. The tracks were approximately .75 miles up the road just past a clearing. These tracks were about 16\" long and 7\" wide. The toe prints were clearly visable. It had rained earlier that morning and had light showers intermittently throughout the morning. The tracks had no water puddling in them and appeared to be fairly fresh. I have been a avid hunter for many years and can distinguish between fresh and old tracks. I never have been a believer in the Bigfoot stories and legends but have since changed my attitude. I didn't really believe what I had found until I took my wife up and showed her. She agreed that they could, in fact, be Bigfoot prints.",
