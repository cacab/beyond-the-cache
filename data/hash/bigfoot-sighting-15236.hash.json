  "observed": "Hi, My brother and I were camping @ Jerktail Landing on the shores of the Current River in MO. It's about 2300hrs and we don't have the fire on yet.  We wanted to see what creatures would get close. This a fairly remote primitive campsite. About 30 feet from us in the woods, we heard the growl and scream of something big. Our instincts told both of us that it could be a Bigfoot. The fire came on really quick after that. We had such an adrenaline rush that we started to giggle like little girls. We never even spoke of bigfoot before and we were not expecting or hoping for something like that. We were there for 4 nights and that happened the first night. We ask the rangers the next day and they said that it could be a bobcat. When we got back home we search for all the sounds from creatures that live around that area, but nothing sound it like it....",
