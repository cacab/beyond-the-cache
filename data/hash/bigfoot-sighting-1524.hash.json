  "observed": "We were just going to sleep, when wife said there was a racoon looking in a small window. That window was at least 5 feet from the ground, with no trees or bushes close by. She persisted so much that I rolled over fast and saw something looking through the glass and it sure was not a coon. Next morning we went looking there was a small clearing, also there was a small stream about 2 feet wide,7 or 8 inches deep we found a heel print by edge of stream about 8 inches wide. By the way, this happened in the Adirondack Mts.",
