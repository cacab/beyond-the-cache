  "observed": "In July,1997 I was with my sister and 2 friends(a brother and sister)in the woods...the sister(not mine)told us that she'd been in the woods the other day and saw a big white thing.*See other sightings below.* After that,I began looking for Bigfoot-like creatures in the woods.About 3 months later,I saw it.I was walking in the woods around 5:00PM with my friend...we were coming through some tall grass when it happened. As we came out of the grass into a field,I saw,in some woods, about 100 ft. away a large(about 7ft. tall)creature stood he/she/it saw or heard us,turned and ran away.It ran very fast.It was tall and actually sort of slim.It had white fur...its arms were long,so were its legs.I did not see it's feet or hands well.I did not see it's face. I have found various footprints and footprint trails-ususally in the snow but sometimes in the mud-they are ususlly about 14 inches long.This may not seem very big,but they are bare ootprints.They also DO NOT have the hourglass shape of a human foot.They are straight. I have also heard odd noises several times.Once at about 5:00 in Sep.97,I was in the woods with two friends.I heard a dog begin to bark,then a deep moaning howl.That was all I heard that time. I know I have heard other odd noises.But I can't think of any specific incidents. I have heard yells,hoots,and crys.as well as howls and whistles.",
