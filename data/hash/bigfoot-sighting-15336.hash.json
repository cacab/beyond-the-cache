  "observed": "im glad i came across this site its helped me deal with my experience. august 2001 is when it happened in fish lake natl. forest utah.  my girlfriend and dogs always take camping trips to beaver,ut july 4th weekend, but because of too many people we started going in mid-august, and farther from state campgrounds to get away. we were fishing at lebaron res.at about 9 a.m.it was sunny and warming up,nights get very chilly up there. it was wednesday and nobody was around, matter of fact we saw no-one in or around our camp or fishing spots for 2 days.  i was standing at waters edge casting my lure when i noticed a bear drinking from the lake about 200 yards to my front right, like 2 oclock. i called my girlfriends attention to it and shes like me, nervous but also like \"cool\" then she says \"its standing up\" then i say \"holy s***\"!i never been so scared in my life in though i didnt feel threatened. what we observed was something walking like a human covered with dark brown hair. it was moving back in the woods it didnt seem to notice us or it didnt care we were there. i am convinced what we saw is a bigfoot. there is no other animal like the animal or thing we saw that day. i didnt investigate afterward. we were headed back to camp to pack and go home. we now are back to camping 4th of july at state run campgrounds.",
