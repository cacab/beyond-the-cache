  "observed": "Encounter as told to BFRO researchers Scott Kessler & Patricia Normand on January 27,2001 by two teenage (both 14 y/o) hunters (K.H. & L.C.) about their encounter November 18th, 2000. We had ridden a 4-wheeler to a deerstand not far from the house. We had been there about 30 minutes. It was near 4 pm and the sun was just beginning to go down. It was almost dusk. We were out there hunting for deer when I told my friend K.H. that there was something moving closer to a group of wild hogs about 40 feet from us.When it got closer we saw what appeared to be a man \"duck walking\" towards the hogs. It scratched it's head and looked around and began to shuffle one foot back and forth (as if it was shifting its weight) .It was also making \"blowing sounds like a deer does\". I shifted my position in the deerstand and hit my shotgun ( 20ga.) against the inside of the deerstand and it heard it and stood up.  The hogs ran off when it stood upright. We bolted out the back door of the stand and jumped on the 4 wheeler and hauled it out of there,after turning a corner and across a small creek I (L.C.) looked back and saw it standing by a tree watching us leave. We had watched it all total for about 10 minutes. It was reddish brown, covered with hair and we could see it's eyes . The face was somewhat covered with hair but not as covered as the rest of the body. It was about 7 feet tall and maybe 300, to 350 pounds.",
