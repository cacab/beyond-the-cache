  "title": "Possible tracks & smell noticed by hunter at Black Mountain outside Whitehall",

  "observed": "Not an actual sighting. However, I recently read an article in the Post Star Glens Falls NY newspaper about a BFRO gathering in Whitehall NY. To begin with, I had never heard of your organization nor knew that Whitehall was a supposed hot spot for Big Foot sightings. Let me tell you my story, all factual. My family and I have owned property in the Dresden NY area (off of RT 22, a few miles north of Whitehall) since the early sixties through last year when I sold my property (located on Blue Goose Rd, old RT 22) last year. Back in 1999 while deer hunting off of Pike Brook Rd. in the Black Mt. area, I viewed some very strange tracks in the mud on a logging road and suddenly an awful, foul smell was in the area. It was a damp, still early November day, thinking back it may have been Election Day. The time was around 8AM as I hiked up the logging road. The smell drifted away as quickly as I smelled it but it was distinct. I've never smelled anything like it since and I have been with hunters that took Adirondack bears and this odor was different. It actually raised the hairs on the back of my neck, it was definitely a strange odor. The tracks were sort of footlike but very wide. The toe area was mushed in the mud so it was difficult to determine if there were claws like a bear or any other type of distinguishing features. In retrospect, I should have reported this immediately but the only person I told was my wife and a few hunting buddies. No one completely dismissed my story but it was like, oh, thats something but I know what I smelled and sensed and it definitely gave me the creeps. I am interested in your organization and I'd be willing to go back to the area with someone involved with BFRO and take you to the site. Please contact me at T********@nycap.rr.com to  discuss. Thank You.",
