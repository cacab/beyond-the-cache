  "observed": "It was early in the morning, I think around 6am. This happened to me in about 1984, it was in the fall. I was going to school at the time, and I'd have to walk about a 1/4 mile to get on the bus. That morning it was dark, and I was waiting for the school bus, I was alone. I was facing the roads and to the left in back of me was a grove of woods. I was standing there and I heard very heavy footsteps in the dried leaves. I moved down the road about 6-10 feet and it took about two more steps. Whatever it was, it was watching me. I was very scared. So I thought I'd walk down to the next bus stop, which was about 1/4 mile away. When I started walking, then I seen the school bus was coming. So I ran back to meet the bus and when the bus stopped to pick me up, I heard a growl behind me in the woods. That day when I came home from school, I looked all around for anything, and I could not find anything. I do know that whatever it was, it was watching me.",
