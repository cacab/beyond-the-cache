  "observed": "This was recorded very soon after it happened in our camp journal. It was the weekend of May 11th 2002.  My wife and I were at our seasonal camp on Lake George for the early season.  We had bed for the night in front of the fireplace.  There were only a few lights belonging to other early season camps across the lake.  It was a calm night.  My wife was sound asleep.  She often sleeps through thunder storms.  I was up throughout the night.  I was awake for the sound of the first scream. The first cycle did not wake my wife unfortunately the second closer scream did.  Someting screamed four times in the distance.  Thirty seconds later it screamed again, on our property.  We have less than a quarter acre of land.  The time was around 2:30am.  Thirty seconds to a minute later it screamed for the last time in the distance at a third location. The scream was in an evenly spaced pattern of four screams.  Each scream was about three to five seconds apart.  The volume was that of human sized lungs.  However, there was no attempt to form words or partial words.  The scream did not change pitch.  It sounded much like a human female.  There was no sound of the creature crashing through the woods.  Please note that a few years back a similar sound was heard by a camp only five down from us.  Other sitings have occured very near to my camp.  The screams made the hair on our necks stand up.  Very frightening.  There have also been sightings of mountain lions in the area.  However, sounds of the mountian lion's scream were not like the screams we heard.",
