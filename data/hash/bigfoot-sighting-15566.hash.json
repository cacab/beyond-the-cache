  "observed": "I was hiking alone 2 miles south of Sabbath Day point Lake George just off route 9N.  The date was March 31st 2006.  I was near a small body of water when I heard odd sounds about three hundred yards away.  The sounds were from a large creature.  They were \"sing song\" in pattern and unlike anything I have ever heard.  The creature appeared to by \"talking\" to itself as there was only one creature.  It did not sound angry and lasted for about two minutes.  The sound change in pitch and fluctuation.  I was not scared but did leave quickly.  I have since studied sounds of coyotes and found no similarties at all.  There were no yelps, barks or growls.  I can not duplicate the sounds.  It is like nothing I have ever heard in the woods or else where.  My wife and I went back two weeks later and found no signs of anything out of the norm.",
