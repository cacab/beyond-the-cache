  "observed": "In the weeks between may15 and June 1 strange bellowing noises were heard which were at first thought to be cows or deer.but the neghbors dog seemed to bark alot when I would hear the noise. The noise also seemed to move around and grow louder and softer, It was almost like an ape or something, It was very intense and bellowing and drawn out.on numerous occasions it woke me out of a sound sleep. Several people have heard the noise including my friend who lives about 3 blocks away. The noises we started to think were from a bear because several over turned garbage cans were found in the morning, my brother said.And because the sound just seems like it would be from a large animal. even though there are alot of large surrounding woods bear were seen in the boro 1 time in the 19 years I've live here. The noises seemed to become less frequent. we attempted to record them but did not have the proper equipment. I recently heard the bigfoot sounds recorde in Penn. i believe and let my friend hear them and we all seem to feel they sound quite similar, if i hadn't hear that I would have just atrributed the noise to deer or bear.",
