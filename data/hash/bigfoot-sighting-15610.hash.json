  "date": "1960-08-15",
  "observed": "I was sitting on the front porch of the house into which my family had just moved.  The porch faced the state highway which was about 100 metes to the east.  The dirt road from the highway to the house was lined to the south with trees.  The house into which we had just moved seemed quite old.  However, between our house and the highway there was a ranch style brick house toward the north of the dirt road.  50 meters to the south of our house stood a barn with a hog pen in front.  The house had a full, flat porch facing the east with four pillars, three steps to the ground and no rail.  My 6 year old sister was closest to the barn.  My 4 year old brother was sitting on the steps.  I was standing next to the steps toward the north.  I heard my sister scream and start crying.  I looked to the barn as a large creature stood there.  It stood a foot taller than the opening of the barn door.  It turned toward the east, its' right, and taking long strides steped easily over the hog pen fence.  When it got to the corner of the barn it looked south then turned to walk west.  Mom came out of the house and told us to stay out of the barn.  Later that day I was over by the barn and saw the large foot prints repleat with toe marks.  Over the remaining time we lived in that house, through the next spring, we heard loud noises at times coming from the metal grain silos to the west of the barn.  Though, we never saw the creature again.",
