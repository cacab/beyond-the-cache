  "title": "\"Brinson Monster\"",
  "date": "1967-08-18",
  "observed": "The date would have been probably sometime in 1966 or 1967, during the school year. Some high school kids had parked in the driveway to the abandonded farm, the old Brinson Place, for an evening of drinking beer or some kind of sexual encounter, or both. They observed a tall animal, standing erect, observing them. It was white or perhaps gray with red eyes. As I recall this happened on more than one occasion. When word of the \"Brinson Monster\" got around, some other kids went out there with a rifle, probably a 30-30, in an attempt to kill it. It was spotted again and a shot was fired, but \"it just kept on going.\" As far as I know that was the last time it was seen in that area. The incident caused some activity in the high school. There were stories and poems written about it in English class, but that, surprisingly, was about it. We didn't know about bigfoot or sasquatches in those days, they had not been popularized yet. People just didn't know what to make of it.",
