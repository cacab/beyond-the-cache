  "observed": "On this particular morning I am confident to report that I had a sighting of Sasquatch. I am a forest worker and build and mantain trails for a living. In the past decade I have had plenty of encounters of the 4 legged species, including cougar and black bear. What I saw this morning was not a black bear (though in my mind I kept hoping it was). I was within 20 ft. of the creature who leaned down under a fir limb to get a better view of me. I had been leveling an area of shale rock trail with my McCloud tool, when I realized that something was slamming rocks together on my right. My usual response is to raise my voice and yell (No bear Go Bear) and with that I usually see a quick flash of black fur and a crashing of brush. Not this time! So I picked up a lage rock yelled with more force and tossed the rock. By this time I had started slowly stepping backwards towards the Suburban, I did not take my eyes of the spot. I thought I saw something move and bent down slightly to get a look at what was moving the fir limb on the tree. I then noticed a movement of dark brown( a leg) and then a face. My adrenalin coursed, I threw my tools in the back of the rig and drove to the other side of the forest where the rest of the crew was working. They are the only ones I trust with this. Being a woman working in the woods, I get teased enough and I do not want to be the laughing stock among the rest of the employees. They returned to the sight with me and even though they did'nt see anything they felt too spooked to stay. So all 3 of us left the area.",
