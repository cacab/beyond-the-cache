  "observed": "My stories begin in the mid 70's at Indian Lake, in Eastern Oregon. It was during the summer youth camp-out. One night at the camp fire, there was this strange yell coming from down the mountain from the face of the dam. I asked and asked but was ignored. The strange yell was getting closer. Suddenly the counselors decided it was time for everyone to go to bed. Once in our teepee, I asked our lead counselor what the strange sounds were. She whispered quite rudely to be quiet and go to sleep. Later that night I was awakened bysomething. I wasn't sure what had awoken me but then the ground seemed to be shaking. Like boom, boom, boom, boom. I was just about the sit up to peek under the teepee when I was grabbed by my arm by my counselor. She hissed at me to be still. The next morning everyone acted like nothing happened! I was so confused. We broke camp pretty fast that day.",
