  "observed": "I grew up in Cayuse over the hill from St. Andrew's. Our Pa would not let us sleep outside in summer time. He said there were too many things we didn't know about that he couldn't trust. Us kids would always wonder but would respectfully obey. Well, onwards to a few years ago. It was during [Pendleton] Round Up and I was getting home to very late in the morning. Probably about 3am. My friend and I were sitting in the car planning for the next day. The engine was running but the lights were off. After several minutes of planning and laughing around, I was ready to head into the house. There are no lights around the house and no moon, so it was pretty dark out there. So my friend turned his headlights on so I could see my way to the front door. As soon as the car lights came on, this HUGE, slender built man went sprinting across the back yard! He was HUMUNGOUS... His head must of been right at the level of the corner of the house. He ran so fast, my mind wasn't sure my eyes had seen what they thought they did. I asked my friend \"Did you see that?\" He, of course, was occupied with his stereo and missed it. I said good night and went on in the house. I kept playing the scene over and over in my mind. The Big Guy was so damn fast... Like 40 yards before I could even blink. His legs didn't seem to stretch out straight like we people do. His head seemed to be sitting right on his shoulders. No neck that I can remember. He was of a darker color brown. The hair covered his body and appeared short. That's all I remember of that night.",
