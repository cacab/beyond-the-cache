  "title": "Daylight sighting by motorist near Laurel Canyon in the Mammoth Lakes area",
  "date": "2006-06-17",
  "observed": "I was living up in Mammoth Lakes, on this weekend I decided to go to Laurel Canyon to do some fishing and exploring. This area is not easily accessible because of the terrain and the road being obstructed by snow in some areas.  As I was coming back down the canyon I came to an open spot along the side of the mountain heading into a more wooded area next to a meadow. The meadow was about 300 yards away.  I was looking ahead of meyself at the beginning of the wooded area  when I saw a human like creature cross the road heading towards the meadow. Its gait was very unhuman like bent at the waist and  arms swinging like you might see a vaudeville actor do at the end of a show as they exit the stage, a bit looney tunes like. I observed it for about 3 to 4 strides. It was all black, long arms (longer than ours), tall, muscular, and slim with no neck visible. It must of been at least 7 to 8 ft. tall and weighing about 400 to 500 lbs. I reached for my camera and that is when I saw it cross back over the road again this time in a slow more human like gait like it was trying to elude something without illiciting a chase response from whatever it was trying to elude like you might do if you saw a growling dog.",
