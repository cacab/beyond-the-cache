  "observed": "Driving North and just crossed the border into Tennessee from North Carolina on Hwy #441 & #71, driving toward Gattlinburg, TN. It was getting dark so we drove on down the mountain. After a few minutes of driving around curves in the highway, we came to a straight section of the highway and could see street lights through the tree covered highway about a mile ahead. There was a curve in the highway where they were positioned. All of a sudden from our vantage point, the lights illuminated the shadow side of a very tall being crossing the highway from the left to the right which was less than a half mile in front of us. We all had a clear view of this being from the shadow side. It looked hairy and not clothed. It was walking on two feet the entire crossing of the highway. We could not see anything when we got to the area this  being had crossed due to darkness. It was ape like in my opinion and large. I found this website and although a its been a few years ago, I wanted to tell what my wife & I and our two friends saw & experienced. I think, Big Foot is in those woods ,,,,,,,,,,,somewhere.",
