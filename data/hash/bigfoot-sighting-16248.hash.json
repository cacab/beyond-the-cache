  "observed": "I was fishing from the south boat ramp at Monksville Reservoir in Ringwood, New Jersey in August 2000.  It was about 2:00 AM - 2:30 AM.  I was fishing from shore when I heard a scream-wail from behind me, on the far side of the gravel parking lot. It sounded kind of like an elk bugle, but not really.  When I found this website, listened to the Washington state recordings, it was almost exactly as I remember it. I ran to my truck, threw my pole in the bed and bolted. When I spoke about what happened the next day to one of the road foremen, who is a 'Ramapough Indian', he immediately said it was probably Old Red Eye.",
