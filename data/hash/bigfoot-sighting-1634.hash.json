  "observed": "In 1976 while night hunting for bobcats on the fringe of the San Gabriel Wilderness Area I called in BF while using a dying rabbit call. I heard it scream so loud that the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goose bumps all over my whole body. I have been hunting now for 34 years and besides hunting 8 of the 11 western states I've also hunted the deep interior of Mexico and I have never heard anything like that before! It was the only time I have truly been frightened! Even though I had a high powered rifle I knew by the shear volume of the Blood Curdeling Scream that what ever it was it was too big to kill with my .243 cal. It sounded like it was mad at me and kept moving to my right trying to get down wind of me. I figured that my very powerful Aircraft Landing Light that I was using to hunt with must have blinded him and hurt his eyes because as he was circling me trying to wind me he never looked my way thus allowing me to catch his glowing eyes.",
