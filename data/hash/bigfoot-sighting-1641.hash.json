  "date": "1998-10-29",
  "observed": "I was squirrel hunting/scouting for deer signs when I came to the top of a small hill.  About 50 yards below me was a large, dark colored creature walking on 2 legs following a fence row.  I  watched it for about 8-10 seconds before it disappeared. I didn't think to compare it to any tree branches to see how tall it was, but it was at least 6 to 7 feet tall. I didn't follow it at the time, I have to admit I was scared.  I came back later, but couldn't find any traces or tracks because the ground was very hard.",
