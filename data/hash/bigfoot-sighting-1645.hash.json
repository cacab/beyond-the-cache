  "title": "Witness observed creature walking up a hill",
  "date": "1971-08-27",
  "observed": "Sitting there takeing a break, enjoying the view of all the hills and valleys with the lake in view. At the bottom of the valley floor, the first hill was logged off, clear cut down to the stumps. And what I first saw was someone walking out of the trees and up the hill. Then what really caught my attention was he was swinging his arms back and forth. His hands looked like they were below his knees swinging. And his knees were way above the tops of the stumps. This thing was BIG! The hill he was walking up was pretty steep and long he was also walking at a fast steady pace. He did not stop once to rest, it was nonstop from the bottom all the up to the top of the hill and into the trees. It took about a minute or so for him to climb this hill. Now I'm a big guy myself (6.1 230lb.)and it would have taken me 5-10 min. to climb this. He looked like he was walking downhill with his arms swinging. He was all solid dark color with no backpack/beltline/hat. Just a solid dark color. Now for me to walk over to where he was I would have to go back down to the parking lot, then down to the bottom of the valley, then about 1,000 yds. NE. all thru heavy under brush. I just didn't have the time for that.",
