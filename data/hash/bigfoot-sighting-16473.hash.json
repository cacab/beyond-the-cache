  "observed": "I was driving on I-10 in the early morning hours.  There weren't any other cars for miles. My friend who was riding with me was unfortunately asleep so she didn't see it. I looked over into the other lane and saw this dark man-like figure crossing the road.  It was really tall, I'd say about 6ft or so.  I walked rather wierd like an ape. I couldn't see any specific colors because of the light but I'd say it was dark brown. That's all I can remember.",
