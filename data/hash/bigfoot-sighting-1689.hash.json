  "observed": "My mother related the story to me in 1969.  I remember it clearly. \"Your father and I had gone to Mt. Adams to picknick and enjoy his new Ford. We had driven some miles up into the hills when we found a partial clearing where we could park and enjoy ourselves. This was when we were engaged in 1941 and were just graduated from Grandview High School in Grandview, Washington. We stayed for part of the day at that spot. In the afternoon we had decided to leave. We had packed up and loaded the Ford with our stuff and were turning out of the clearing to go back to Grandview. As we were leaving I turned to see if we had left anything behind us and noticed something black moving in the clearing next to where we had parked. What I saw was a tall black creature covered with hair and very muscular walking quickly across the clearing parallel to us towards the forest. I said to your father, 'Look, whats that,' and pointed behind him at the creature. He slowed the car back down and looking where I pointed he said he didn't see anything. By the time he had slowed the car and looked the creature had dissapeared into the forest. I was the only one that saw it. When I told him what I had seen he said it was only a bear looking for berries to eat probably. I didn't want to argue with him as we were close to getting married and I didn't want to ruin a great outing and throw cold water on what had been a beautiful trip.",

  "location_details": "It happened in the foothills of Mt. Adams at the Western end of the Yakima valley.  I don't know what the county was but I'm sure it was west of the city of Yakima, Washington on the East side of the mountain.  In 1941 there were very few roads into what was basically wilderness.  Only a few forest service roads went into the timber, unpaved."
