  "title": "Possible sasquatch seen squatting in a road near Flatwoods",
  "date": "1996-01-16",
  "observed": "It was approximately 11:00 P.M.  Me and a friend of mine were walking down a gravel road near my house.  We observed a large object in the middle of the road about 200 yards from our position.  It looked similar to a large ball or something.  My first thought was that it was maybe a tree stump or a large rock was in the middle of the road.  Then I began to wonder how such a large object ended up in the road to begin with. We continued walking towards the object.  Once we were within 100 yards of this thing, we observed this large black creature rise up from a crouched position and face us.  This thing had to have been at least 8 feet tall.  We could not make out any distinguishing features, but we did see that it was black, and appeared to have fur that sort of glistened in the moonlight.  When we saw this creature, we immediately froze (we were petrified) and observed it for about 20 seconds.  I believe it was looking at us but I can't say for sure because it was so dark.  After that, it turned and walked into the woods next to the road. After it walked into the woods, my friend and I turned around and ran pretty fast to get away from the area.",
