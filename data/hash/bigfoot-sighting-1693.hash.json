  "observed": "My freind and I were scouting a cliffband on top of a timbered hill at about 7000'. We had ascended to the top of the cliff via a steep gulley and enjoyed the view from a flat topped buttress. There was one 4-5' juniper on the flat area. As we were returning to the car we hiked into a meadow about 3-400 yards from the cliffs and turned around to look at where we had just been. I was suprised to see that in addition to the lone tree there was another dark form that was swaying back and forth. I thought to myself, \"thats cool, there's a bear up there\". Then the \"bear\" stood up and walked off the flat area down into a small rocky notch and up some steep rocks then disapeared into the timber. It apeared to cover the distance in about 4-5 strides with very fluid motion. We hadn't spoken yet, only 10-15 seconds had passed. All we could say to each other was, \" I thought that was a bear!\" and to remark that the hair went up on the backs of our necks when the \"bear\" stood up. We hiked back to the truck and had calmed down enough to eat a snack while sitting on the tailgate. We were about 3/4 miles from where we had seen it. My freinds young mix breed dog began growling and looking at the woods just where we had walked out from. This was too much and we quickly split.",
