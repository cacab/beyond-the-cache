  "observed": "It was the winter of 79-80.  I lived 7 miles west of sidney mont. I was traveling home one night after work at aproximatly 11:30 pm. The weather was cold below zero, light snow was drifting across the highway, The terrain is rolling hills no trees other than what is planted by the local farmhouses. I came up on what we call a coulie where the road is built up between the rolling hills and has guard rails the length of the coulie, What has to be bigfoot crossed the road in front of me at the end of the guard rails, headed north, he was well over six foot tall, he didnt even turn his head to look at me, he just walked across the road. his stature was the same as the bigfoot that was filmed in the woods that was on sightings? maybe, the only difference i saw was that his hair was not extreamly long or matted, but light colored and the wind was whipping through it and it was darker at the skin than at the tips. I was a 17 year old that was traveling alone and you can just imagine the fear that caused. I regret not stopping there the next day to look for the prints in the snow but it was such a terrofing experience i could not bring myself to stop.",
