  "observed": "It was around 11pm december 31st 2006. I had just got back from a 9 hour drive from florida and I was sitting on the couch with my uncle watching the end of the bears packers game. My sons mother called and I was talking to her when i heard a sound at the window. The only way to discribe it is a hooting sound something like a monkey. Since the lights were on in the house I couldnt see outside so I looked over to my uncle to see if he was messing with me. He was looking out the window and thought I made the noise. Then he jumped up and said \"Did you see that\"? I looked over to the window and saw the bush moving outside. He grabed one of his guns we were planning on shooting at midnight and ran outside. Once he got outside he could see more movement at the end of the house and I heard a grunting noise near my sisters window. It sounded like it came from a big animal, sounding something like uhhhh uhhhh. His dog max heard my uncle yelling whos there and ran around to the front where he was. As soon as max got there he stopped barking and whimpered as he backed up to my uncle. The dog wouldnt get near the side of the house. We didn't hear or see anything for a while so went back inside. When we came back out at midnight we heard some noises but they were far off. Except for that, we didnt hear anything else all night.",
