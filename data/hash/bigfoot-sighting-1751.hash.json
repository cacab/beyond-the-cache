  "observed": "This was related to me by my daughter's boyfriend.  In the fall of 1998, on the wooded ridge running east west just south of our housing area, Mud Run Creek lies in our platt just below the ridge. It was a dark night and early morning, fall but warm weather so no coats needed.  The boyfriend, his Dad, and a younger cousin were camping up on the ridge.  The boys were about 13 and 8 years old at the time.  At about 0200 to 0300, the two boys got out of the tent to go to the bathroom and noticed something moving just in the shadows in a pine and cedar clump of trees about 50 ft away from their campsite.  Both boys saw the movement, then asked each other if the other had seen something.  They had both seen it.  It moved around in the shadows, and stood watching them at about 30 ft but they could only see the dark shape outlined near a tree.  He said it looked about 7 ft tall and big, standing on two feet like a man, but looked fur covered as much as they could make out in the dark.  They were scared so went back in the tent, but didn't sleep much.  Later that morning, about 0600, they were startled upright when they heard a weird howling some ways off to the west down the ridge.  His family are outdoors people so he goes on hunts and he knows the sound of dogs or coyotes.  He said it wasn't dog or coyote.",
