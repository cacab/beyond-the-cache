  "observed": "About 1/2 hour before sunup two of us were elk hunting in James Canyon Fairview, Utah.  We heard a scream from across the canyon which repeated every few seconds for 5 or 6 episodes.  It shook the forest.  I have spent my whole life in the woods all over the West and know there is no animal in America that sounds that loud and piercing.  10 years later it dawned on me what we had been privileged to hear -my hunting buddy agrees and we heard a similar recording on a web site.  It sounded like a mix between a baby crying, a mountain lion roaring and a bull snorting.  Since then I have talked to 3 friends that have eyewitness accounts -one of them gave me a cutout of a footprint that they found near their ranch in Idaho.  It is huge and there were 3 sets of prints all different sizes.  A university in Boise came and did plaster casts.  Anyway, those that have seen are normal in every way.  If you want more info let me know.  P.S. I have a great theory that explains where sasquatch came from, why he is so intelligent and why they will never be caught or hurt another human.  Thanks for the good work and keep it up -Dan Robertson - 208-852-0429",
