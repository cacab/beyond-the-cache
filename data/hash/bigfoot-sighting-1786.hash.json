  "observed": "Me and my friend Mike were hiking in some woods not too far from my house in northern Indiana when we heard a noise.  We (being 13 year old kids) decided to check it out.  We kept finding peices of wood around some foot prints.  Then I heard another noise and when I looked over my shoulder there was a hairy ape-like being about 6'8\" no more than twenty yards away.  Our instincts were to run, so we did.  When we returned to my house my mom did not believe us.  That was my run in with big foot.",
