  "observed": "I accidently wrote my experience down in the space that was supposed to be used to describe weather conditions. It was late afternoon, clear skies and good visibility although the tree canopy blocks out a good deal of sunlight from the forest floor.Look in the weather/time of day section for my report (sorry) I don't type very well and haven't the time to re-do everything.",
  "classification": "Class B",

  "location_details": "Like I said earlier, there is this gift shop that is completely contained inside a living redwood tree on the highway 101 ave of the giants scenic route. About 5 miles north of that is a small day use area with a small parking lot and restroom. I believe there are several trails leading out of there. We took the one to the north. It's very heavily forested in the area and doesn't seem to get much use although I cant't be sure."
