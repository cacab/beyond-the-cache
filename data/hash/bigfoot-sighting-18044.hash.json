  "title": "Nighttime sighting by motorists on Hwy 101 near Hannah Swamp",
  "date": "2007-02-27",
  "observed": "As we were coming home from church about 9:30 pm, on  a Wednesday night we were headed down HWY 101.  We were driving slower than usual because it was so dark and there wasn't alot of traffic on the road, making sure we didn't hit any deer.  As we were approaching a curve we spotted movement on the right side of the road.  We slowed more because we thaught it was a deer.  As we got closer it decided to cross the road.  It was so big it seemed to be a bear.  But as we looked closer it was only on 2 legs instead of 4.  It was so tall it seemed to walk hunched over dragging its arms.  Were we seeing things???  We got chills as we passed an old swamp clearing in Paulding Co.  and realized that we had heard tales of Big Foot in this area and after researching what we saw, we know 100% that we saw him.  It was the biggest, widest creature I have ever seen and really didn't seem to be bothered by us and then he just disapeared, like in the blink of an eye.",
