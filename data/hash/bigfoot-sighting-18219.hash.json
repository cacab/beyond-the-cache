  "title": "Motorist sighting near Missouri River Bluffs (@ \"Monkey Mountains\")",
  "date": "2007-07-17",
  "observed": "While traveling along Dark road skirting Monkey Mountain in NW Missouri, a tall thin creature of possibly 7' in height crossed the road in front of my vehicle. The creature was coming off the steep side of the hill heading towards the river areas. This animal was quite thin with sparse hair that was long and flowing, I got the impression it was quite old. It did not seem to notice I was there. It crossed the 10-12' wide roadway in approx. 3 strides, it was unhurried. I was not able to return to look for tracks, however I am planning on returning to the general area to investigate further. There have been reports following the Missouri river to North of Kansas City for years. Including a possible encounter at a military base on the Kansas side in Leavenworth County, KS.",
