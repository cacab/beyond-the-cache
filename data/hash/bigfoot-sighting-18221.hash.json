  "observed": "march 9 2007, Me a freind and his Dad were snowmobiling in the boundry waters area of minnesota. when I came across prints in the snow that I could not explain. We drove our snowmobiles through 2 portage trails and onto the second lake where I spotted the first set of tracks. The strides in the tracks and depth of the snow convinced us that they were not made by man, but were similar to man's walk. We took pictures and proceeded to the first lake that we portaged too. Here I had found similar tracks on the 1st lake as I did on the second lake. I did not take any pics of these prints at this time. march 10 2007 We had another couple come up to snowmobile with. They were skeptical of what we had seen and I proceeded to take them with me to show them the prints and found another set I had missed from the day before. We took more photos and they were very convinced we had found something unusual. March 11 2007. I then proceeded out with my buddie from the first time out to look for more tracks and found a trail on the north side of the lake that appeared to be  more heavily used. We took more photo's and found something even more unusual in one of the photo's. It appeared there was an infered lite coming from a tree in the distance that I did not notice till investigating the pictures I had taken at home on the computer. It's possible someone else was monitoring the area for activity.",
