  "observed": "I live in Indiana and feel that I have heard one of these amazing creatures.  I have heard them in back of my house frequently over the past 3 weeks.  Sometimes it sounds like something is hurt, sometimes it sounds almost like a train whistle.  We live close to a train tracks so we can tell the difference.  There was also a deep mark in the mud behind the shed one day, and some pumpkins that were leftover in the field from last fall were suddenly gone one day, like they were carried away.",
