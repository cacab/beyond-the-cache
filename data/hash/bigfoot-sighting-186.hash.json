I wanted to see something ahead of us real quick before heding back to my house so he sits down while i go ahead. I walk about 50 feet, not quite out of sight of my friend when this HUGE, tall hairy creature was kneeling. I turned to run and it chased me! I caught up with my friend. I didnt have to tell him what i saw. He saw it and ran with me. We got out of the woods and turned around and it was gone. No noises or nothing. We didnt bother to tell anyone. We were both white because my mom asked what was wrong but we said nothing and went on about our business. We never forgot it though.",
