  "observed": "My wife and I were leaving my parents home  located on the edge of lake Alatoona.  While saying our good-byes outside, the four of us heard an extremely long and loud howl.  The howl lasted about 5 minutes causing several dogs in the area to begin barking and howling themselves in response to the  strange howl. The \"unknown\" howl wasn't a dog due to the length of the howl and tone.  After reviewing  the recordings referenced on your home page, both my  parents, wife and I beleive that the \"howl\" of the  creature in these recordings was almost a perfect  match.",
