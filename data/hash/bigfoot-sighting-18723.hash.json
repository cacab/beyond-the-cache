  "observed": "My sister, her husband and I were driving home from Bartlet lake after some night fishing.  It was around 12:30 a.m.  We were on a dirt road with tall embankments on either side.  My sister was driving slow and we were both looking at my bro-in-law while he told a joke.  Out of the corner of my eye I spotted something in the middle of the road. About 50 yards away in our head lights I turned and saw it!  I have never seen one before but somehow I immediately knew what I was looking at.  It WAS a bigfoot.  It was around 7 feet tall. Walked up-right.  Cow red.  Long straggly dirty hair.  It was acclimated for the desert because his hair was very thin not thick like a bear.  It didn't seem to pay us no mind as he crossed the road in only a few strides.  What sticks out in my mind the most is how it got up the steep embankment with no effort. It just walked right over it. The sighting only lasted a few seconds but seemed to go in slow motion.  I always thought that bigfoot was a hoax.  For me seeing is believing.  I am a true believer now because I DID see it.  I feel very fortunate for this experience.",
