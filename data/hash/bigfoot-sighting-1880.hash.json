  "title": "Man and his children find large barefoot tracks in snow",
  "date": "1977-12-29",
  "observed": "Mr. Becker said on the 29th he had taken his kids sledding up on Green Mt. He drives a GMC 4-wheel drive TK, so they decided to take the Green Mtn. Rd. up toward 3 Fingers Mtn. After driving for a few miles they stopped and tied the sled on the back of the TK. Several times the sled would tip over and they would stop while his son put it back on the road. When Mr. Becker asked him to put it in the middle he said there was a pile of droppings there. Mr. Becker took a look and noticed that the droppings were from a wild animal, but did not think anything of it until later. They began pulling the sled up the road again. On the next stop they noticed a trail of large footprints going up the bank. They went over for a closer look and discovered that they were just like human's bare footprints with 5 toes. It suddenly came to Mr. Becker that this could be the legendary 'bigfoot' that he had read about on several occasions. He kept the kids back so as not to disturb the tracks. He then put his foot in one of the tracks for comparison. He had on a pair of heavy snow boots and there was an inch difference on each side and 2 or 3 inches at the front and back. He spread his legs out next to the tracks to compare the stride. He said he practically had to do the splits to match the stride: which would be about 4 to 5 feet between steps. A couple of prints were pushed all the way to the ground under the snow. With his weight, even jumping up and down, he could not sink half that far. He thought of the pile of droppings and figured it could have come from what ever made the tracks. He thought the tracks were from 1 to 2 days old at the most. It was getting late in the afternoon and starting to drizzle so he decided to take the kids home and come back another day and get some pictures and possibly follow the tracks to see where they led. After thinking about it the next day he decided to call the Sheriff's office and report it. This is where Jerry Phillips comes in... he worked with the Sheriff.",
