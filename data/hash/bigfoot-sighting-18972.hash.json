  "observed": "I was driving down the road and needed to use the restroom.  I stopped my vehicle and turned my lights and the motor off so I could hear if any other vehicles were coming.  I smelled a very strong odor coming from the road in front of me.  It smelled a lot like a wild hog.  I turned the headlights on and standing approximately 30 yards in front of me was a large hairy creature 7 to 8 feet tall.  It had large eyes and a large mouth and it's hair was very long and shaggy and very dirty.  It had it's arms out to it's side like it was surprised that I turned the lights on.  It's arms were very long, longer than that of a human.  It stood there for a few minutes and then took two long strides into the woods.  I did not look for tracks that night, but came back the next day and did not see any, but the gravel road is very hard and there was pine straw on both sides of the road in the woods.",
