  "title": "Late afternoon road crossing near Cibecue (Fort Apache Reservation)",
  "date": "2006-10-15",
  "observed": "Hello my name is XXXXXXXX in the year of 2006 I was employed as a Forest Ranger patrolling the West End of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation I was sitting by the side of the road, right before the start of the airport.  I was waiting for woodcutters to return,so I can check their permits.  At this time it was about sundown but it was still light enough to see, I noticed a creature which resembled a man but was covered in black hair, but unlike the BigFoot reports this creature was about average height and I estimated the weight to be about 200 lbs.  I thought I was seeing things, the creature crossed from the northeast and headed west above the cibecue school. It crossed so fast by the time it crossed the road I was stunned and I drove toward the direction the creature crossed hoping to get a better look but it had already crossed into a gully.  I was afraid no one would believe me so I kept it to myself.  I don't know if what I saw was a juvenile BigFoot but whatever it was it seemed to disappear and the creature didn't seem to know I was there since it crossed about 100 yards in front of me, I was backed up off the road.  It was scary and I didn't want to get off my unit and investigate or look for tracks.",
