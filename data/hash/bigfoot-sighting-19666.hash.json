  "observed": "I was recently discussing your web site with a friend and was directed to the sounds that were recorded and placed on your web site.  Initially I laughed it off.  At least until I heard the Ohio Howl.  I have heard that particular sound before.  The only difference was a slightly higher pitch.  When I heard the sound on your site I got the same goose bumps and the same sick feeling I had the first time I heard it. I was on an evening deer hunt in mid to late December.  It was cold and clear with a light wind.  I was sitting on the ground backed into a cedar tree.  At one point I could hear something walking up behind me.  I could tell it wasn't a hooved animal by the sound the feet made when it walked.  I waited about 10 minutes looking for it to step out of the brush.  That's when I heard that sound.  It couldn't have been more than 20 ft away, because it was so loud I had to put my hands over my ears.  I immediately clicked the safety off on my rifle and could hear it moving back deeper into the brush.  When I couldn't hear it any more I got up and went to the truck without finishing my hunt.  I told my grandad about it and he shrugged it off and said it was probably just a big coyote. I have hunted my whole life.  I have been calling and trapping predators for close to 20 years.  My degree is in Animal Science.  I know what coyotes, dogs, and wolves sound like and that isn't it.",
