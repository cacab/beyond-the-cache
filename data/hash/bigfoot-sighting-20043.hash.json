  "observed": "I noticed that you are doing an expedition in the U.P. of Michigan.  My husband and I go to his families cabin in Wetmore which is in Schoolcraft County on the Chain of Lakes.  In June of 2006 we were standing out on the deck at around 10:30 and we both heard from across the lake back somewhere in the woods (it sounded like the area of Pine Marten Run Trail) a loud grunt/howl sound.  It sounded exactly like the calls from your website. Then again this June 2007 we were up there again and there was another sound that was loud and it sounded like muffled talking.  It sounded like something was trying to talk but not using English words.  We were both pretty startled. Then that same trip we went searching for a particular lake in Schoolcraft county, we found it and went down a road marked site 2.  I was looking around and my husband was fishing down at the lake.  He called me down there and there was a very large human shaped foot print where the sand met the grassy area.  I put my foot in the track and it fit but it was just much bigger.  I have a strong feeling there is something up there and hope that this helps with the expedition they will be doing in July.",
