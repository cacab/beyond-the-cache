  "observed": "I walked out onto the forst road just north of the Red Creek Campground.  About 300 yards north walking down the forst road was a figure walking up the forest road.  The \"person\" was from head to toe in a seamless dark color, lighter than black and darker than brown.  There was no gap of skin and it appeared the hands, neck and head were the exact same color as the body.  The \"person\" was walking in the same direction as me and thus did not see me.  Suddenly, the \"person\" tore off into the brush very quickly and where there is no trail.  The \"person\" never emerged from the side of the trail. I confess I was quite far away from the figure so I never got a really good look.  But it was either a human clothed from head to toe in a dark color on a summer day wearing dark gloves or it was something else.",
