  "observed": "Two years ago, I went with my Uncle to stay at a cabin in Mammoth Lakes to hike, fish, and just enjoy the nature.  We had a cabin right on the border of Lake Mary and he had brought his two sheep dogs with him to the cabin. Every night he and I would take turns taking the dogs out for a walk. We would bring a flash light with us each time we went out to walk the dogs. One night when I was walking the dogs, one of them started growling and I listened closely and could hear the rustling of fallen leaves and the breaking of small branches. I shined my light right at where I heard the sounds. Now both of the dogs were growling and pulling at the leash trying to get at whatever was in the forest. I looked around closely with the flashlight and then I saw something. A huge figure about 200 feet away from me was watching me and the dogs. It was kind of swaying between the trees and just staring right at me and the dogs. It looked like a very tall ape, but it looked more built like a human. I was scared stiff and I must have stood there for a minute or two holding the dogs back and staring at the creature when it turned around and started walking away. I then walked very fast back to the cabin watching the woods and not stopping for anything. I have never spoken of this incident with anyone before in my life and I have recently heard about this sight and thought it was finally time to talk about this with someone who would understand.",
