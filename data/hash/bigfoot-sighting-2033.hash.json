  "observed": "I was taking pictures for my Photography class at Haskell University near the Wetlands.  I had walked over a pile of dead and chopped wood into the woods about fifty feet when I heard something ahead.  I looked up and saw something standing there, then immediately take off, and without much of a start jump about 7 to ten feet in distance over a fallen tree which was about five feet high.  It disapeared into the bush, and did not make a sound in its retreat.  The first moment I thought it was a worker from the nearby factory wearing a big coat, then I quickly realized what it was.  It had a full body of dark blonde/light brown hair, about 6'6\" or taller, and had a slight slouch to itself.  It was also very fast, very illusive, and had seemed to disapear in a glimmer when it took off.  I could not hear it beyond the brush where it took off to, so I thought it was still close by.  So, as scared as I was but with a camera in my hand I had to follow, but when I got into the brush there was nothing.  I didn't hear anything nearby, no bushes moving, no twigs cracking, nothing.  Though I felt as if I was being watched, as if something was still there, close by.  I just took a deep breath and took off to my car and went home.  It was the coolest yet scariest moment in my life.",
