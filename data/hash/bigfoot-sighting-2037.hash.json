  "date": "1997-07-01",
  "observed": "Various things observed during 2 summer field seasons working on my Master's degree thesis in the Northern Sierra ( 14 months total). 1) I stopped to look at a topographic map about 20 miles west of Quincy,Ca on the Quincy-LaPorte Rd-heard a modulated guttural scream-did not see anything-area is open Douglas Fir forest. 2) 3 different instances smelled a strong human feces smell while hiking -mostly in trailless manzanita/Douglas Fir/Talus slope areas-Slate Creek area. This area has great topographic relief. 3) Set of footprints and 3 pieces of feces -Upper Slate Creek. Footprints were found in soft fine silt overbank deposits on a meander of the creek and were approximately 11 inches long. I could very easily see the dermal ridges of the 5 toes, ball and heal. No discernable ball of foot was observed. Footprints were \"square\"-almost all toes were of equal length,ie: flat across the top. The 3 pieces of feces were approx. 3 inches long and 2 inches wide -light and dark brown mottled. A very faint human feces smell was observed.",
