  "observed": "My friend was driving my Lincoln  continental while I was sleeping.  It was very late. About 1:30 AM.  He screamed and slamed on the brakes and said is a very loud and surprised voice.  Did you  see that?  I said no, but you certanly woke me up.  I asked what was it?  Thinking a deer or a possum in the road. He said. Well, I don't know. I said well go back.  His reply to me was.  No way. That thing was tall dark and hairy and was walking on 2 legs. This event took place back in 1982. We talked about it the other day.  He said he can still remember how this thing stride across the road. It saw the car and kept on going.  He guessed we were about 75 feet from it when the car lights came upon him. To this day he swears that he saw a \"Big Foot\".  He is not one for making up stories as he is a \"Born again Christian\" and is a school teacher as well as teaching in Sunday School.",
