  "observed": "While we were hiking we began to hear what we considered to be a scream/moan.  Then when we looked to our left we saw the head of a non human species look towards us from behind a tree and stare for about 30 seconds then ran away from us at a very fast speed.  It looked that of almost a human figure in which it was about 5 or 6 feet tall and looked fairly large...That was only the first of the occurences in which we have seen this creature.  To this day we still sight the beast around our woodland homes and have heard the screams and cries of what we believe to be Bigfoot.",
