  "observed": "I live in Kimberly Idaho. While my grandson was here visiting we drove to the South Hills in the Sawtooth Forrest.  We turned off on a dirt road called Wolstrom Hollow. I have been there many times looking at the beaver dams. We drove as far as we could then parked my pickup and walked for about 1/4 mile more, when I saw, through the trees, a silver object and thought I heard people talking, which would have placed them where the beaver dam is.  I stopped and noticed a lot of elk and deer droppings and a very strong smell. I asked Brandon if he smelled it and he said no. He said he kept hearing loud sticks banging together or against rocks.  I could not hear that, but I kept smelling a very strong odor.  Then Brandon said he saw a scary thing, at about the same time my dog, which was on a leash, barked very loud with her hackles up.  I said lets get out of here. On the way back to the pickup Brandon says he thinks it is following us, and my dog keep looking back.  I just said keep walking, I didn't want to look like prey. At that time I didn't know exactly what he saw. We got in the pickup and drove out. Brandon then told me he saw a large hairy thing, hunched over, very tall, bigger than a bear and had peircing yellow eyes.  He kept telling me it looked him right in the eyes and scared him so bad he couldn't move or talk. Please let me hear from you.  I had to tell someone.  Then I talked to a friend who hunts and ride horses in the mountains and has cattle up in that area.  Well he said that someone reported a bigfoot sighting around there about 3 years ago, and they saw the tracks.   I am too afraid to go back there by myself.  I think we stumbled on it eating an elk or deer. Carol Sherman csherman_7@msn.com",
