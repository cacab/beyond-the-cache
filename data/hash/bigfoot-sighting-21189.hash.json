  "observed": "My Wife and I Were traveling yesterday on the Lady of the Lake II out of Chelan Washington.  We were heading from Chelan to Stehekin on the north end of the Lake.  About half way up the lake we were dropping off 70 fire fighters at Lucerne.  Just as the Boat was leaving the landing I saw something large and dark walking on the shore were a creek (I believe it's called Holden creek) runs into the lake.  I saw it for a few seconds and told my wife that I thought I might have Just seen Bigfoot.  I showed her the spot and told her to keep looking while I got the camera.  She said \"I see it\" she said \"it looked like an orangatang but more upright.\" I ran to the bow with my camera.  I looked around and saw the creature walking back up into the woods it had very dark brown hair covering its's entire body.  It looked to be between 7 and 8 ft tall and probably weighed between 400 and 450 lbs.  It had long arms and a long loping gate.  I fired off three pictures hoping to capture a picture of this amazing creature.  I ran in and told my wife and kids what I had seen.  I looked back at the digital images and initially saw nothing because I don't have a tele photo lense, but later that night in Stehekin I was loking at the pictures and zoomed in on the part of the shore wher I had seen the creature and there he was!  I had started to doubt what we had seen but now I have A picture to prove it to me when I begin to doubt it.  I did not necessarily believe before this.  Nad my wife and I were definitely not looking for bigfoot when we both saw him. ",
