I HAVE ALSO SEEN THEM SENSE IN OTHER PLACES CLOSE TO THISA SPOT. THIS MORNING I HAD STARTED HUNTING AND IT HAD BEEN RAINING AND IT WAS FREEZING. THE FOOTPRINTS WENT THRU A PUDDLE OF WATWER THAT WAS FROZEN ,OR HAD ICE ON IT . THE TOES ON THIS FOOTPRINT WERE EXTRA LONG FOR A HUMAN AND IT HAD NO SHOES ON IT. IT MADE NO EFFORT TO AVOID THE WATER. THIS TRACK WAS SEEN THIS TIME IN THE NORTH WEST EDGE OF THE APPLACRACOLA FOREST. JUST SOUTH OF WHAT IS KNOW AS RIVER STIX.",
