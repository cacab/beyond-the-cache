  "observed": "ok. this story is happening right now...went out with my kids, my sister & my girlfriend to the park in auburn ca. after that we went driving through a very rich housing development to see the address signs that i made for the houses at my work, we were close to a lake called lake arthur. it was about 7pm? sunday, today, sept 30? we walked along the trail there about 30 ft. came upon a large tree branch or small tree, about 13 ft long, 12\" in diameter. i picked it up on end and tumbled it down the small hill side/river bank, then again to get it in the water...very heavy. no apparent reason for it to be lying across the path at all. continued on deeper down the path about 1/4 mile or more to a dead end. by this time it was very minimal light, started walking back our dog took a crap in the path ahead, and you could see it darker on the yellowish oak leave covered dirt path, and we could see to avoid it, when we got to the area that i moved the tree, my son said to me, watch out there is something dark and smooshy there, i stopped and looked at it, he said to me, it looks big though. it was a freshly wet imprint of a foot shape, and there were more leading from the lake up into the woods up a steep hillside. there was one great print, and a half a dozen others about 3'- 4' stride. and one like a slip or slide on the hillside. i said it looks like a small bigfoot print, because of the heel, and ball of the foot and a strange toe pattern. like pinky toe on the side of the foot. my kids got scared after that....i walked up the hillside where the prints lead about 20' into the woods, very minimal light, i saw 2 large black shapes laying down, one very large, and one about my girlfriends size about 5 feet away from the big one. both lying down.----girlfriend is about 5'1\"heard noises, and backed off. as we walked the path the next 10-15 ft, we heard bipedal walking 2-3 steps, stopped when we stopped, and then continue. took my kids home, got my pistol, for protection only of course, and went back with my girlfriend. we took photos of the prints and measured them approx. 8\" long. not very big. indentation, approx. 1\" in pretty hard dry dirt. prints were wett and the rest of the ground was dry every where. my thought-maybe a curious smaller one came down and checked out the tree i pushed into the water and left the wet prints on the way back up? i have more on this, i hate typing, you can tell with my shortness in descriptions, i went back and heard an actual deep breath/slight grunt and more bipedal steps, scared me, even though i know they dont tend to harm people, i totally believe in bigfoot, and i have never seen or heard anything before. i am extremely skeptical, and i study  these kind of things. give me an email address so i can send the photos. i am going back in the morning. i am very excited about this. i have the photos, and 5 witnesses. my son found the tracks....they were almost crying to go home after the walking we heard. it was very heavy...not a bear, atleast the tracks were not. small human foot print with pinky toe on the side of the foot. not like your typical bigfoot print.this is within miles of sugarpine area, and foresthill. i have seen alot of stories in these areas on your site.",
