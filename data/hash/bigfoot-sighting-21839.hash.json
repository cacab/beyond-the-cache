  "observed": "I drive truck for a living with my wife traveling with me.  My log books will verify place & time.  We saw a big foot sprint across the road on HWY 93 approximately between conner, MT  and lost trail pass/Cheif Joseph Pass.  I live in MT.... know what a bear looks like and that a bear can not stand upright and run like the creature we saw.  He only passed in front of us about 40 feet as we were heading south.  Both of us saw it plain as day.  No doubts in our mind we saw a sasquatch.  The river was next to the road and no place to pull the big rig over. William Earl Thornton (e-mail address removed)",
