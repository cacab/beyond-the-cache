  "date": "1977-11-15",
  "observed": "By the way the images captured by Jacobs are similar to what I saw near homestead Fla 30 years ago in the Naranja area off of Old dixie Highway. This creature can stand verticle and run a deer down easy. It is going to be next to impossible to capture. They run as fast as a cheeta perhaps faster. They are very curious but cautious and are easly spooked.",
