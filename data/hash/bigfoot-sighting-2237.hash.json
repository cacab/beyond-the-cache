  "title": "Early morning encounter on North Texas backroad.",
  "date": "2003-10-10",
  "observed": "In March 2001 at 4:30 am on my way home from work, on the back roads, something crossed in front of my headlights, this \"thing\" had long hair, long arms, between 6-7 feet tall and traveling fast. It crossed the road in front of me in 2-3 steps, it stepped over a fence and went into a coastal field out of my vision. It was grayish color but everything in that area is covered in rock crusher dust so it could have been any color. This \"thing\" was not as hefty as the pictures on your site, but he was tall with long arms. He stood on two feet like a human with long arms and didn't run but was lumbering across the road. I told others at my work about this and two other men saw the same \"thing\" on April 12, 2001 about 1 mile from where I saw it. My boss saw \"it\" when he was a young man and stated it screamed like he had never heard before and couldn't mimic the sound it made. We live in Texas and are hesitant to speak about this but what I saw that morning was something I have never seen before.",
