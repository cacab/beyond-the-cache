  "date": "1980-06-10",
  "observed": "I was 12 years old, working for my father at a construction sight off of a dirt road, just north of Chapel Hill, TN.  My dad and uncles were building a house for Rickey Sweeney, early in the summer. My uncles, Ricky and Jimmy and I took the work truck to a small country store to get a midmorning snack for the crew.  On our way back to the work sight, we turned onto the dirt road, lined with thick overhanging trees.  We went about a quarter of a mile, when from our left (South) a very tall (7' +), somewhat slender animal, covered with dark fur, head to toe, ran into the middle of the road and stopped as my uncle slammed on the brakes. The bipedal was about 50 feet away.  All three of us started screaming, and my unlce Ricky tried to get the truck into reverse gear.  The animal had what looked like pieces of clothing under one arm and dragging on the road.  The animal broke itself out of it's fright and bounded off north, across the road, jumping a 4 and 1/2 foot fence and up the hill, quickly disappearing. We returned to the work sight and I proceeded to tell everyone there about the remarkable incedent.  This story has been coaberated by my father and both uncles, and has been an exciting experience to relate to others.",
