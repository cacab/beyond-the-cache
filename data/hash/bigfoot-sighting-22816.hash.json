  "observed": "I wanted to report this now. I should of the first incident I had. This was on a cool morning, Sunday. I remember the day because I work earlier on Sunday's than the rest of the week. It was November, 2007.  I was up a little before 5AM and then let the dog out to do his thing. What I heard when I got outside was alarming. It was a howl or moan coming from some distance away.  My dog doesn't care when he hears other dog's howl or bark, but this got his interest.  I have heard cougar and coyotes howl, that wasn't it. I had heard this sometime ago when I started to research sasquatch, I came across a howl or moan from Westmoreland, PA. It sounded very similar. This is why it creeped me out.  It went on for about 10 minutes, then I had to go back inside to get ready for work.  When I came out again about 30 minutes later it started again, but in short bursts.  I wished I had some type of recording device.  I have listened for the same noise every morning since and haven't heard it again.",
