Incredible lung capacity! Every 5 seconds or so it would repeat. It appoached from the river (got louder)...moved west...still howling...then quickly moved south/back from the river up the terain....howling as it retreated..untill it wasn't discernable. I've hunted with friends in the Colorado Rocky's for black bear, elk...have heard their death throws. . .and I've NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE.",
