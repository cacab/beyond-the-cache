  "date": "1998-07-01",
  "observed": "I live in Columbiana County in Ohio. My family alone has seen this creature 3 times in ten years. Once I saw him on my way home from work in North Jackson. It was a rainy night but I am POSITIVE about what I saw! It was in the light! I still see it clearly in my mind! The calf sizes and leg size, the color, all the way up but didnt get the face. It was huge and it was dragging a dead dear or large goat behind it. I was very scared but at the same time wanted to stop and get out to take a look. I slowed down but couldnt stop. If it killed an animal I wasnt sure what it would do to me! I do believe in Bigfoot now.",
