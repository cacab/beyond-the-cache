  "observed": "I was walking home one evening, I have to walk through  the graveyard on a paved road. It was right at dusk when I looked out into the graveyard to a far point over looking the WV Turnpike. I saw this large creature moving about the tombstones as if to be pacing back and fourth. It would stop sometimes as if to dig at a grave. It was very large, dark hairy appearance, ape like movements, shrugging of the shoulders and sometimes a hop to its step.
