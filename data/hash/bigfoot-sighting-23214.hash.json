  "observed": "Sorry if duplicate, I keep hitting some key that throws me out of this page. Auditory report. Returned home after Vol Fire Dept meeting and heard weird howling.  Got my digital voice recorder from inside the house and obtained roughly 4.5 minutes of it on tape.  Ululating howl with some echo off of nearby cliff face.  I estimated the sound to originate (nearby).  I am an avid outdoorsman and have lived in the Black Hills for over 40 years.  This sound was odd, did not fit the pattern of any animal species I am aware of. We have Coyote, Mountain Lion, Big Horn Sheep, White Tail deer (occ. Mule deer) frequenting my home place.  Bobcat, skunk, etc.  Elk are within 1-2 miles. Wild animal park (Bear Country USA) is (nearby) and has Black Bear, Grizzly Bear, and Wolves to name a few.  We often have sounds from there drift in and what I heard was not any of them, either.  Would like someone there to listen and render an opinion on the origin of the sounds. On 20th sound was more distant, perhaps 1.2 to 2 mi, fainter and without the echo.  It appeared to be originating North-Northwest that night.",
