  "observed": "Sounds in the woods and the sights of tree limbs or structures shown are everywhere in the sowega (southwest Georgia) area of Georgia. I grew up in the crisp county area and most of my life was spend on the flint river area. we (family) always heard the loud cries and grunts which most thought were large cats. Even on a trip to mexico beach, fla. in the 80's, we saw one run across the road just before the stop sign for highway 98. We know that they are there and don't care if anybody thinks other wise..seeing is believing!!!!!!!",
