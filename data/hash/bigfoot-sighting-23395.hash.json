  "observed": "Me and my son and daughter were hunting deer during the 2006 youth deer season.  My son shot and wounded a deer and it ran into the woods. We all three went into the woods looking for it. Something started to beat on a tree making a hollow pounding sound. Then a lot of thrashing noise and tree shaking. I got scared but did not want to scare the kids so I said lets go.  We got about 100 yards from the truck and smelled a real foul odor exactly like rotting meat. I mean real bad. At the truck it smelled so bad it was hard to breathe. I know there is something out there. My kids both saw this creature. It was black and hairy and it climbs trees. About six foot, broad shoulders, no neck, a lot like a man but hairy.",
