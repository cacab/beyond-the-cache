  "title": "Juvenile Bigfoot crosses road and clears a fence near Fowlerville",
  "date": "1978-07-01",
  "observed": "Livingston county, Michigan, approximately 1978, east of Fowlerville on Allen road, just east of Hogback road.  I was about 14 years old and I was with my older sister who was 16.  It was early evening we were coming home from a friend's house.  We turned east on Allen road from Hogback road and traveled about 1/8 mile when all of a sudden we were stunned to see something extremely unusual run across the road in front of our vehicle.  As we stuggled in disbelief at what were were seeing, we both became nearly frantic, shouting at the same time. What we had seen is was what to this day we describe as a \"baby\" bigfoot.  The creature was upright, approximately 4.5 to 5 feet tall, moved extremely fast on two legs, and was completely covered in hair.  What I will never forget is the visual sight of it running across the road and then, in one single, seemingly effortless bound, leaping completely across and clearing a livestock fence that was approximately 4 to 4.5 feet tall.  To me, that was the evidence that this was no hoax; a human of such stature could never have made such a bounding leap.  Somewhat skeptical in nautre, I will never forget that day, and have absolutely no doubt about what I saw that day.",
