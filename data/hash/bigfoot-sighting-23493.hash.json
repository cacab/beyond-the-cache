  "observed": "yesterday me and 3 friends went drivin around in the woods looking for some 4x4 trails up the east hoquiam road. we were drivin for over an hour and started running into snow, it was about a foot deep. then as we were drivin up this hill my friend driving in front of stopped suddenly  right at the same time i seen some deep impressions in the snow on the side of the road. we got out and took a look and there was about 6 footprints in the snow, i wear a size 13 boot and it was about 5-6\" longer than my foot. the tracks went into the brush and stopped, so i snapped a few pictures and then we drove on up the hill. we got to the top and my friend yelled at me and said there was more tracks, but then said they were just human tracks so i didnt bother going up there just yet. there was a deep canyon below us that was clear cut, i keept scanning the hills hoping somthing would move but no luck. i started walking up to where my friend was and noticed the tracks he told me about and i started following them. (they followed the edge of the landing then cut back and went up the hill then stopped and came back down the hill), as i got to the top of the hill i noticed one of the tracks i could see a distinct toe print, then after that i noticed the length of the stride between the steps, it was about 4ft. i yelled at my friend to come back up here these are not human tracks. i showed him the distance between each step, it took me three regular walking steps to equal one stride from the bigfoot tracks. i know these are not made from a human, it would be impossible for someone to make these tracks with the length of stride it had. the tracks were to clean. i tried to take a step that big and i could barely reach that far. im 6'2, i had to stretch my legs as far as i could and i still wasn't quite there. i have several pictures if your interested in seeing them.",
