  "observed": "I have been haunted for 5 years by an experience I had when I lived in Door County Wisconsin.  I lived in a small town called Forestville.  We lived in the woods.  I should have called the DNR when it happened but I wrote it off as a bear even though I know all the bears in Wisconsin are black.  What I saw in a thicket beside my house was redish brown.  I walked down my driveway to get the mail....it was very early Spring.  I heard loud noises that sounded more like a man than an animal.  I peered through the thicket and all I could see was the hump of its' back as it pounded its' head or shoulder against the tree.  It was large.  I was so very curious to see more that I walked up onto our mound so I could look down into the thicket.  I could not see it better but it must have picked up my sent or seen me because it ran toward me.  I could hear it running and growling.  It hit some downed trees and could not catch up to me....I heard it hit the trees as I was running to my back door.   I am not crazy.  I am an educated woman.  I know what I experienced.  I have contacted the DNR of Wisconsin from where I live now because I just have not been able to get the experience out of my mind...it haunts me.  The DNR said it could not have been a bear.  So what was it??",
