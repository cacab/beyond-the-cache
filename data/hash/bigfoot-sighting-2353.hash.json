  "observed": "I went fishing with a friend at Lake Thunderbird about 6 years ago. We started fishing in the afternoon as the day went on we stayed till it got in to the evening. As we were fishing later in the evening me and my friend started hearing strange noise from the other side of Little River which runs in to the lake. It sounded  like a very large man breathing and it was getting closer to us. Then me and my friend started to notice the animals around us were going the other way from the noise. It made me think there is something out there and it coming this way. I started to get very nervous because we could hear branches breaking and it was getting closer to the other side of the river. I became real nervous when my friend said look at all the birds flying the opposite way and in a hurry. Then we heard a loud splash in the water and we figured it was time to go. That something was very upset with our presence in the area. I told all my friends about it they thought I was crazy and to this day I have never been back in the area to fish. I have grown up in the southside of Okc all my life towards the lake and have never heard anything like that before and will never forget the sound it made and the animals running away.",
