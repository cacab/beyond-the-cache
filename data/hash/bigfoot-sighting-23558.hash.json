  "observed": "My boyfriend E. P. and I were with our good friend D. I. who was driving an F150 pickup truck.  We had gone up onto the logging roads for the boys to teach me how to shoot a shotgun better. It is very desolate and has very thick forests. We went in near the Elma/Satsop, WA area and drove for hours.  We ended up getting lost but knew the A and B line roads (which we were on from what the Garman told us) came out somewhere near Capitol forest. By this time it was pretty late and we were ready to go home. We ended up turning around somewhere in between and found ourselves going around a corner with a hill coming down on the left hand side that had lots of tall pine trees and low laying brush/stumps.  The next few moments all kind of fade together so I will try to type them out as clear as possible without the cursing involved.  I was sitting in the middle seat and I saw a flash of HUGE eyes first in the headlights. By this time I had said \"holy **** look at that\" and D. I. had stopped the truck and opened his door and gotten out because whatever it was was at about a 35 deg angle on the left side not even 100 yrds away from us and my boyfriend sitting on my right had no clue what was going on.  Let me just say that both boys I was with have done lots of hunting and are familiar with animal reactions and their sizes/eye shape, etc.  I am still sitting in the middle of the seat and my boyfriend has gotten out now too and I am FROZEN in fear.  I feel like 5 minutes go by that I am staring in to the largest greenish glowing eyes I have ever seen. I felt like time literally stopped.  D. I. with his door open to my left is so shooken up that he cannot even get the bullet into the shotgon, or even hold it.  All of the sudden my boyfriend said I started shrieking and screaming, and I felt like I was snapped out of a trance and I saw its outline.  What sticks out the most besides the eyes was huge forearms that it seemed to be proping itself up on. I didn't notice color.  It was atleast 700/750lbs.  I kept screaming and now crying(I never even knew I was) and both boys jumped back into the truck, my boyfriend was still wondering what D. I. and I had both saw. My nose started gushing blood (the first nosebleed I've had in many years) and I don't know if it was from the absolute terror of the moment. The thing didn't move the whole time which is so strange even for a bear or elk in the headlights.  We drove off and it RAN up the hillside that was slanted up to the left. The next hour in the truck was so weird and D. I. didn't want to talk at all about it. All he would say over and over was \"that was huge, the eyes, huge..\"  We all wanted to get the hell out of the woods. The next day he came over.  He said one really weird thing was he woke up with a nose bleed and he hadn't had one in many years too. We talked more about it and it kept getting more strange to him.  He is the type of person who talks himself out of things like this to not seem like a pussy.  I am not the type of girl that gets scared easily. I never scream or cry I have grown up camping and backpacking in the woods and have seen many animals.  Never in my whole life have I experienced something so strange, shocking, and terrifying all at the same time.  This happened a couple of days ago and I still cannot sleep a whole night through without thinking about it.",
