  "date": "2008-04-08",
  "observed": "I live in Frisco Texas, and me a friend go kayaking at the greenbelt quite often, Denton county, it connects lakes Lewisville and lake Rayroberts together, We started kayking and probably went about 2 miles when we came upon a log jam we could not get around. So we had to get off the water and go around it on the shore. When we were about to put our boats back in the water my friend yells for me to look at something and we came upon a series of unusual footsteps that looked non human but bigger then any other animal that is in this area. I did some research and noticed that there hasnt been any sightings in this area but these are very unusual human like animal tracks. I do have pictures.",
