  "observed": "As I was hiking in Ocala National Forest I noticed a suspicious-looking formation of small trees off to the right side of the trail. I have seen videos of similar structures that were attributed to Sasquatch activity and I was also well aware of the activity in that area from reports that I read before I went on the trip, so this really sparked my interest. The structure appeared to be about 8 1/2 feet tall at the point where the trees and branches connected. What surprised me the most was the fact that it was not constructed entirely of broken branches, but mostly out of trees that were broken down and still rooted. The entire structure was composed of 6 broken trees and 3 broken branches (this is not including the \"base\" tree). One of the details of the structure that really stood out to me was the single tree that was bent down, twisted between two trees that were still standing, and then added into the main structure. If this is some sort of Sasquatch-made landmark put there for whatever reason, I don't know for sure, but I do know that it wouldn't have made much of a shelter. That wouldn't make much sense to me if it was considering it's location and lack of practicality as a shelter. I think this is directly related to the Sasquatch activity in the area, and if it is some sort of land mark, whatever made it did a pretty good job of building it. I actually had my video camera on me at the time. I have included that video below.",
