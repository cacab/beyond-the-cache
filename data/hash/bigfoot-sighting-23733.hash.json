  "observed": "We were hiking up a ridge above a friends cabin. We had stopped to catch our breath and check out some stone formations. After about 10 minutes waiting for one of my friends to come back from a possible stone formation, I was looking uphill and saw a head peaking around a hickory tree and brush. It was moving back and forth from around the tree. There was a lot of dead tree fall and vegetation between us but it appeared to be sitting on the ground. I could see a face, head and shoulder of what appeared to be of a primate. I asked the friend closest to me to come behind me slowly and look over my right shoulder. I pointed in the direction of the animal and he about fell over. The eyes were dark and the face appeared to be covered in hair/fur. The head was crested and covered in fuzzy hair. The hair came down the head and became longer as it transitioned into the shoulder area. The hair was an Irish Setter red. There was a very short neck area. It was100 to 125 feet away from me.  It appeared to be smaller than me. I am 6 feet tall 280 pounds. After watching it for about 5 minutes (as it watched me), my other friend started to return and it started walking back away from us. I lost sight of it, but it reappeared a short distance to the left of the previous position and began peaking at us from over the top of the vegetation it was hiding behind. This time the peeking was very quick with a minute between appearances. We watched this for about 15 more minutes and then did not see it again.",
