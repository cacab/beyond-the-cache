  "observed": "May 4th, 3:30 am Sunday morning, Elkhart Indiana. I am typing this for my brother as he stands here and relates what he experienced. Currently he has no internet hook up. Our dog Diamond, who is blocked off in the kitchen awoke me wanting to go outside. I proceeded to the kitchen and opened the door for her. She jumped out and immediately reversed and came back in. I stood at the door and heard a sound. It most sounded like the clip of the Mississippi howl. I have never heard anything like that, and it sent chills up my spine. I have never heard it before or since. I did not notice anything else unusual, except for the dog do not make a sound.",
