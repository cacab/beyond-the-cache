  "observed": "In September of 1998, my son and I were trying to sleep in my camp trailer. We were in the Prescott National Forest, near the Yolo Ranch Headquarters. We were archery deer hunting. We were camped close to another camp with several young men in it. They were drinking and playing music loud enough to keep my son and I awake. It was about 9:00 PM. Both my son and I heard a peircing scream emanating from the woods behind the camp trailer. I asked my son if he heard the scream and he said yes. I asked if he recognized what it may have been and he said no. We have both been in this area many times and have heard about every animal sound that could be made in the area. Elk, Cougar ( Mountain Lion ), Cattle, Fox, Coyote. etc. This was very loud and peircing and wavered slightly. It happened three or four times and we could not identify what it was. Apparently the people in the other camp did not hear it, as they continued with their party and nothing was said by any of them about it. Whatever it was sounded as annoyed with the disturbance as we were. I didn't think much about it being Bigfoot because I had never heard of any sightings in Arizona before checking you web page. I think I had another encounter with one in Mississippi in about 1973. Should I submit another story?",

  "location_details": "From Prescott take Miller Valley Road North about 20 miles to Camp Wood turn off. Then go about another 20 miles on dirt road past Camp Wood to South Mesa Road. Go about one quarter mile to the second turn and then turn to the left. Take the faint road for about 100 yards then take the right fork. 200 yards more, you will find a faint road to the right. I was camped at this junction."
