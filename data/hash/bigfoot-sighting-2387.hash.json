  "observed": "I was camping at Del Norte Campground outside of Crescent City California.  I woke up very early in the morning before anyone else.  It was about dawn. I was walking to the campground bathroom and I heard the loudest yelling I've ever heard that is hard to explain in words.  It echoed all thru the mountains.  It was a yell by something, but not a man, bear, or wildcat.  It took place 3 times. Needless to say I ran the rest of the way to the bathroom and my heart was pounding.  I don't know how else to explain it but with a yell or a hollar but so loud it would echoed off the trees and thru the mountains.  I didn't see anything, but I was too afaid to do any looking. A while after that I was watching a big foot documentary, where someone had recorded sounds they thought to be big foot.  This was the exact same hollar I heard.  It made the hair on my arms stand up.  I've never seen that video since and I would love to see and hear it again.",
