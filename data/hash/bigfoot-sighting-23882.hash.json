LATE ONE AUTUM EVENING OUR NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET CALLED MY DAD AND TOLD HIM TO GET HIS WORK TRUCK IN THE YARD AND GET TO HIS SHOP BECAUSE SOMETHING WAS HEADING THAT WAY. HE WAS VERY UPSET. HE STATED THAT HE WAS COMING HOME FROM WORK , IT WAS DUSKY DARK, WHEN HE PULLED IN HIS DRIVEWAY AND STARTED UP THE HILL TO HIS HOUSE HE SAW SOMETHING VERY LARGE AND HAIRY AND DARK ON HIS PORCH. WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS HIT IT,IT TURNED AND TOOK OFF RUNNING. IT STOPPED AT THE REDWOOD FENCE ALONG THE DRIVEWAY RIGHT AHEAD OF HIS CAR. THIS FENCE WAS 6 FT TALL , AND BEFORE DONALD COULD GET HIS CAR STOPPED IT CLEARED THE FENCE , ONE LEAP FROM A STANDING POSITION. HE PARKED THE CAR AND RAN IN THE HOUSE AND FOUND HIS WIFE SITTING IN FRONT OF THE DOOR POINTING A PISTOL AT THE DOOR, SHE WAS CRYING AND SHAKING. SHE STATED THAT SHE HEARD SOMETHING JUMP UP ON HER PORCH AND BEGAN TO PULL ON THE SCREEN DOOR, MAKING IT POP. SHE SCREAMED AT IT TO GO AWAY BUT IT CONTINUED TO PULL ON THE DOOR. IT ONLY STOPPED WHEN HER HUSBAND DROVE UP. MY DAD LEFT AND RAN ACROSS THE STREET TO OUR PASTURE TOWARD HIS SHOP, HE SAW A LARGE THICK MAN-LIKE CREATURE RUN AND LEAP THE CREEK, WHICH WAS A LEAST 10 FEET ACROSS. THE ONLY SOUND HE HEARD WAS A GRUNT WHEN IT LANDED ON THE OTHER SIDE. HE CAME BACK AND GOT HIS TRUCK TO DRIVE TO HIS SHOP BUT HE NEVER SAW IT AGAIN. MY DAD OR OUR NEIGHBOR WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD SEEN IN LATER YEARS. OUR NEIGHBOR JACKIE AND GLENDA LIVED BEHIND US AND THEY REPORTED NUMBEROUS ENCOUNTERS WITH WHAT THEY CALLED THE BOGGY CREEK MONSTER, THEY HAD A LARGE PINE THICKETT BEHIND THEIR HOME AND SAID THAT THEY HAD SEEN AND HEARD IT MANY TIMES AND AT TIMES IT WOULD RAID THEIR RABBIT HUTCH.",
