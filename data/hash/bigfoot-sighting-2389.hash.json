  "observed": "A few years ago my cousin and I were outside and heard very loud noises, I've hunted, camped, all my life. I have heard many animal calls, I've heard them all. These noises were very loud, and highpitched. Until recently I've always wondered what these noises were. I was watching A&E In Search Of, Bigfoot, they were audio taping trails where bigfoot was sighted. I was shocked when they played these tapes. They sounded exactly the same. An experience like this will really wake you up. This is no bull, people laugh, make jokes but its true. We did not find anything, it was dark and hard to tell in what direction the noise was coming from. We Looked around the next day and didn't find any sign on the ground or on the trees. Its not a mystery to me anymore, I know the truth.",
