  "observed": "I had just climbed down from my deer hunting stand and quietly walked to the edge of a large soybean field. The moon was full and I thought perhaps I would see deer running from the field. What I saw was still creates goose bumps on my arms. Standing 30 feet from me and approximately 20 feet from the woods was an extremely large creature. It was between 7 and 8 feet tall and could have weighed as much as 500 pounds. It had a very short neck and arms that reached nearly to the knees. It made no movement toward me. The face was not visible due to the time of day. I was loaded down with compound bow and portable deer stand. I cannot detail the fear I experienced getting back to my jeep. I didn't shine the flashlight at it, as I was too frightened. The next day I went back armed with a 300 Weatherby to look for signs, but the ground was to hard to see tracks. There were no bushes in the field. There was no mistake in what I saw.",
