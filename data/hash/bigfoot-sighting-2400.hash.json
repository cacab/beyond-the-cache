  "observed": "This parcel of land was where all of us kids would play at. No adults ever came out so we were free to do what we wanted. One day my cousin and I went out to this pond that was in the middle of this land. The land was all woods, sometimes thick areas, with a small creek that ran though it. We went out to the pond and were standing around when I looked into the woods and saw a black hairy creature standing there watching us. I showed my cousin and then we ran away. We told our parents but they never believed us. I never saw this creature again.",
