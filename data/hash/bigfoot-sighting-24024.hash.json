  "observed": "possible vocalization? this happened when i was a sophomore going into junior year of high school. it was summer and me and about 10 of my friends went camping to the rainbow falls state park. they have alot of wildlife listed on their website to be known in the area, but none that would make a noise like the one me and one other friend can recall. after we put our fire out and people started going to sleep me and one other friend were the last to be up, we sitting on the picnic bench talking, about 5 minutes later we went in our tent where everyone else in our group was already asleep. we layed down and a couple minutes later i started to notice this high pitched howling noise way in the distance. at first i didnt think any thing at all of it, me and my friend who was awake were joking that it sounded almost like tires screeching way in the distance. It only caught my attention recently when i was browsing the bfro site and listened to the puyallup recording and it sounded almost identical to the noise i heard that night in rainbow falls. It gives me goosebumps when i hear that recording, just thinking about the whole incident now.",
