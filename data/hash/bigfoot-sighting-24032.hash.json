  "date": "1978-01-01",
  "observed": "Just watched a TV show which made reference to the Skunk Ape/Bigfoot of Florida. As I have seen one, I was interested in learning if other sightings had occurred in the same area. While searching for this info, I came across your web site.  Even though my sighting was 30 years ago, I remember every detail as if it were yesterday. It was early morning (8-ish) New Years day 1978. My sister had picked me up at the Tampa ariport the day before. I was home on leave from the Army. We had spent the evening with friends in Lakeland and set out (6:30-ish) for Ona. We were driving south on Hwy 37 and had just started across a bridge over the Alafia River. In the passenger seat I had a clear view of the river. On the south side of the river, squatting at the edge of the water was a large dark haired skunk ape. He was splashing water over his shoulder. I yelled for my sister to stop the car as I opened the door to jump out. I ran to the bridge rail. He looked up at me. His features were more human than ape like. He stood up, seeming not afraid at all, looked at me for a moment and then turned and climbed up the bank into the woods. My sister saw him as he entered the woods and was concerned he would come onto the road after us, so we returned to the car and left. He was big, well over six feet, had a massive chest and arms, and was covered in shaggy dark hair. His face was not as hairy as his body. I did not feel threathened at all.",
