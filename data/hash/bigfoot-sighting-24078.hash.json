  "observed": "Me and a friend were coming back from indian ford park in jennings state forest by hattie nolan road. As we were walking back to my house we saw it standing approximatly 40 yds away. It stood at least 7 ft it looked like i would come up to his head. Our first instinct was to run. After days of keeping silent I talked to my teacher Mr.David Wright. who is a part of the bfro. I told him about our incident and he handled the situation professional. A few days later Mr. wright and i then went to site where it happened and he took photos of twisted trees that littered the place.Then as we were walking back he performed one of their calls and with in seconds we got a reply.We tried it 3 more times and got responses from different directions.And the really weird thing was that ive never heard an animal sound like that",
