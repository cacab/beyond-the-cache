  "title": "Man Has Face to Face Encounter Outside of Willits",
  "date": "2008-07-08",
  "observed": "On my way north on Highway 101 about 11 miles north of Willits I observed a very large creature jump up onto the roadway  and bound across three lanes , while slowing my car down to approx. 20 mph, when it ran directly in front of my vehicle and jumped down into the ditch and then shot up a steep hillside. I got a very good look at this thing and I know that it was about 7 feet tall , had a black wool covering the whole body with a face like untanned leather, almost yellow. It looked like it was running on the hind legs and was using its massive arms,leaning forward, to pull itself along. The head was really round and the wool covered the ears completly. This animal was on a mission to cross that freeway and I would have hit it if I hadn't slowed down",
