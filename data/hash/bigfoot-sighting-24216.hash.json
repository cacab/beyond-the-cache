  "observed": "The night of the 4th of july me, my finace, my son and my friend and his step brother were camping across from the humptulips fish hatchery at the mouth of stevens creek..we got out there about 5pm and got camp set up and built a fire and got settled in. we stayed up cooking hot dogs and talking till about 11:30pm then me and my fiance went to bed, my friend stayed up till about 2:30am...thats when the whooping started..right after he went to bed the sasquatch started whooping from across the river, it woke me and my fiance up from a dead sleep...she asked me what it was and i said it was the people camping down the river bar just making stupid noises...i knew what it was but didnt want to freak her out and pack up at almost 3am..the first thing that entered my mind when i heard this was the whoops from the 1974 recording from california..it was almost identical to it but the ones that i heard had more of a primate tone to it...i do believe there was 2 of them communicating because there was one just on the other side of the river not to far back in the timber..(the one that woke us up)...then occasionally we would hear one farther away, then the closer one would whoop back in response...this went on for an hour. i fell back asleep about 3:45 or so....i didnt know my friend was awake at the time but when i woke up in the morning i asked him if he heard the sounds last night and he said he did..he was trying to talk himself out of what he heard till i asked him about it. this camp site is about 15-20 miles away from where i found the footprints in the snow earlier this year report #23493.",
