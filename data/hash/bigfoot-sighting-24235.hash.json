  "title": "Man recounts watching a sasquatch cross road near Cross Anchor",
  "date": "1991-12-06",
  "observed": "In 1991, I don't remember the exact date, my wife, then girlfriend, and I were riding around the backroads of Cross Anchor trying to see any deer crossing or standing on the side of the road. This was our typical date, all you redneck country boys will understand. I don't remember the name of the road we were on but it was between hwy.49 and hwy.72  not far from ridge rd. back toward Clinton. It was around 1 or 2 in the morning. We were going down this road and way out in front of us, out to the point where the headlights barely reach, we saw something cross the road on two legs. I punched the gas and sped up to try to get down there so maybe we could see what it was. When we got to the area where it crossed I stopped and rolled the window down and was shining my mag light in the woods. Back about maybe twenty yards in the woods I noticed this tree that had a big lump on the side of it. Well, I focused my light on that tree for a few seconds just looking when all of sudden this thing stepped out, looked right at us then turned and walked on into the woods out of sight. At that point I didn't know what to do. My wife was yelling for me to get out of there so I hit the gas and drove off. Being dark as it was, it's hard to say just how big it was but I would guess around 7 feet tall. It looked to be covered in brownish hair all over. I'm not sure about the face, I couldn't see it that good. The only reason I knew it was looking at us was because it's eyes were glowing red from the flashlight. I've hunted that area for years, and I've heard a lot of unusual things but that was the only time I ever seen anything like that.",
