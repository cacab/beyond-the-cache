  "observed": "In 1983 I was camping in the woods near what is now Crystal Ridge housing developement off of Shaw Road in Puyallup, WA. Around 11pm I was awakened by a screaming sound in the distance. It sounded kind of like a woman, hard to describe really, but it absolutely got my attention. Every 15 or 20 seconds it would scream and I could tell it was getting closer and closer, after a while I could hear crashing in the bushes. Whatever it was it was moveing fast. I rationalised it in my mind as a deer jumping through the woods quickly. But when I saw the outline of the deer I knew immediately what it was. Granted it was dark, but with the moon out and lack of cloud cover I could make out a black shape 7' or 8' tall striding through the underbrush. I paniced and yelled as loud as I could and the creature slightly changed course to go around me and kept on going, still with the occasional scream. In the morning I looked for footprints and hair, but all I found was broken branches, too high to be broken by a man.",
