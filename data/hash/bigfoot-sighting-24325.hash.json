  "observed": "I had the most incredible thing happen to me on the morning of September 29 2007 in Carroll County, VA. I was driving on highway 94 heading from Fries, VA to interstate 81 in fort Chiswell, VA. I was coming down what is known as Youngblood Mountain, just above the entrance to a fishing hole called the \"Cathole.\" it was a very warm and foggy morning. What I saw next completely caught me off guard. As I exited the last curve, I could not believe what I was seeing. Standing on the side of the road was a thing that I had only seen in the movies or heard of through folklore. I was in awe of the thing I was seeing. It was 20 feet from what I know was bigfoot. It, he, was crossing a three strand barbed wired fence in one stride. This thing had to be 7 and a half to 8 feet tall. It walked with kind of a lumber. It never once looked at me, as I had stopped in the middle of the road to watch it walk away. The hair was a reddish brown and about 4 inches long. It had no neck and the smell was that of a wet dog. The arms were very long, about three inches below its knees, but in proportion with its body. I have hunted these mountains for years and had only heard of legends of a hairy beast man and I had never seen anything like I was seeing on this morning.",
