  "observed": "We were conducting Marine Corp Training exercises. Our last training event was a mock war to apply what we had learned.  So, my squad was over on top of a hill ridge over looking saddle.  We were waiting for the enemy to come up the hill so we could engage them, but then we heard a noise from behind so we turned around to see what what it was. We thought it was a bear about ten yards but it seemed like it was taking a knee so we stared at it for about a minute then it got up onto its feet and started walking to our position and we did nothing as it walked between our fighting holes which were about 15 feet apart. As it passed by us, it knew that we were there because it didn't keep his eyes off of us, he  looked down at me directly as it passed by then he stopped about 15 feet away, and turned around, but not completely, he turned at his waist to a look back and disappeared. It was big, at least 7 feet tall.  I mean his body was muscular. It was the biggest thing I had ever seen",
