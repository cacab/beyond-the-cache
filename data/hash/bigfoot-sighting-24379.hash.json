  "observed": "On Monday July 14th 08, I was driving on my mail route. I rounded a corner that leads into an approximately 3/4 mile long straight a way. Up ahead at a distance of around an 1/8 mile I saw something in the road that at first glance I made out to be a bear standing upright. I carry my mobile phone that has a camera. I grabbed it hoping to get a pic of a bear. As I approached, the \"bear\" walked upright to the side of the road. By the time I approached the spot where I had seen the object on the road it was just on the side and starting into the brush. It had just stepped off  the side of the gravel shoulder as I snapped the picture. I was approximately 30 yards or so away. I really don't know for sure what I witnessed, but I will say this, I have seen bear, elk, deer, all kinds of wildlife around this area. I drive it daily. This was NOT bear, elk, deer, etc. Whatever this was I had never seen before and it was BIG. I have explained to people that I am a skeptic, but after this I have had a little change of heart. I really do not rattle easily, I am a big ornery biker type that rides a Harley and usually will be the first to call B.S., but this was different. I did stop at the spot where it walked into the trees. there is a stump that it was partially behind when I took the picture. Judging by the area behind the stump I figure it had to be about 7 feet tallk in order to be seen over the top of the stump.",
