This was right in the middle of a snowstorm.  I stopped to read the map and reasure our directions.  While looking at the map, I turned the rear view mirror light on to help see the map.  in the mirror I caught sight of a huge manlike figure running up behind the vehicle, I turned to get a better look and my wife turned too.  She screamed (Oh My God)!  It was clear to see a huge hairy (black & brown) furry being. It was very tall, large head and long arms, running on two feet toward our vehicle.  No other vehicles or tracks in the snow.  Large pine trees bordered the highway.",
