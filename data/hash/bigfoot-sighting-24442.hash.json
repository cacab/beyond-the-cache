  "observed": "It was late at night.  We had a St. Bernard that loved to take long drives.  We decided to take a drive in the Pocono Mountains of PA. We would take familiar roads, then usually find a woodsy road to cut off on.  That night, I believe we were in the Bushkill Falls area (which should be in Monroe County).  We were on a narrow two-lane road in a heavily wooded area.  We approached an intersection with no stop signs.  We actually stopped to look at a map.  All of a sudden, a very tall figure crossed right in front of our car.  We were shocked!  It must have been at least 7ft.+ tall, long arms, hairy body, ape-like appearance, very slender.  It walked completely upright and just crossed over to the other side of the road.  There was another car that approached this small intersection--that car also saw it, because he stopped the car--remember, this was a back road with no stop sign.  Shortly after we had seen this creature, there was an article in the local newspaper about sightings in the state of PA.  I cut out the article and saved it, placing it in a book for safe keeping.  After awhile, we moved and the book with the article disappeared.   I tried to contact \"The Morning Call\", but you had to check out their archives to get any information.",
