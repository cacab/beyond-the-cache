  "date": "1978-06-01",
  "observed": "This took place in the summer of 1978 at a place called Clouse Lake in Perry County, Ohio. I was ten years old at the time, about to turn eleven. I was in the woods playing explorer with three other kids. All of a sudden, it got very quiet in the woods. We also got very quiet, but continued to walk through the woods. I was in front and we were walking single-file. We were following a deer trace. It went around a large tree in the distance. I started to smell something very malodorous. I rounded the tree and I almost ran into it. It was a huge, hairy creature, very smelly, over six feet in height and dark brown in color. It was NOT a bear. It had an almost human face. The creature spun around and I screamed at the other kids to go back, now, as fast as they could. We ran back to the parking lot of the lake as fast as we could.",
