  "observed": "hello all i am a 56 year old woman that has never gave a second thought to the life of what people call a bigfoot.I knew him as whistling Paddy as a child that is what my Grandparents and all the neighbors called him.Our neighbors were far and few between but every one of them knew the whistling paddy that is what they called him.I myself can remember his screaming and whistling sounds as a child.We lived in the deep woods in Ethridge Tennessee no electricty or indoor plumming.He was always around and we were used to his sounds and he came for scraps at night he did not eat any meat only pealings from patatoes and other veg.He or she was white with red eyes like as i know some folks are called alibalino i guess.My grandparents were not learned people they could not read or wright they had to sgin with an x but they knew he was real and they did not fear him and saw him or her lots of times and thought it was okay they called it him so i guess it was a male.My aunt who lived about a mile awat opened her back door one night to throw out her dishwater and threw it on patty because he was standing at the back door It did not scare her because she was used to him although she had 9 children she went and got some potatoes and gave him for she said he was hungry.This Paddy was about 7 to 8 feet tall and did not ever hurt anyone.I would like to know if anyone else has ever heard one called a whistling Paddy because that was what he was called when I was a small child growing up in those woods.And we did not fear him but we had to come inside right before dark cause mamaw would say paddy is out here and we can't trust him we dont know who he is.If anyone else ever knew of a bigfoot that was called  by the name of whistling Paddy i would like to know my grandparents were Indian and knew many things but were not smart when it came to the real world they knew how to get by with 10 children and live a good life in the woods and how spider webs packed into a wound would stop bleeding and they knew as i did paddy was real.",
