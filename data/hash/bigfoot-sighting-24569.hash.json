  "observed": "My husband and I were traveling west going over skyline drive in Virgina near Strasburg.  (this was many years ago 1970) WE saw a large hairy thing. It looked like some of the pictures we have seen about bigfoot.  We were so shocked we just stopped and then looked at each other and said what was that.  We still remember this as if it happened yesterday.  We Know it was not a bear because it ran on 2 legs.  It crossed the road in front of us and then ran down the side of the road an into the woods.  We were young an never new who tell about it.  So it has just been something we tell to family and friends about. Sure wish we'ed had a camera then people would be believers.  We definitly are.",
