  "observed": "My friends picked me up from work and asked me to go camping with them. We drove all the way up to the top of the Sonora pass about a mile or so past the Kennedy Meadows area we pulled off the road toward the left. We drove down about 200 yards into a flat area between two mountains and set up camp. We got there about 6:30pm. We were there for about an hour and a half. To be more specific of the time, it was just beginning to get dark or dusky. We had already scouted out the area and had just returned to the camp when all five of us heard a very loud crashing noise. At first I thought it was a tree falling but then I immediately saw a fast moving object running down the ravine which was about fifty yards away from our camp. I then thought it must be a deer but then is when I saw it at it's closest position to me running in an upright position across the large granite rocks that lay in the ravine. My judgment  was very clear at the time of the sighting and so what I think it was is a very intelligent creature with tremendous speed and strength running like a man and covered in dark hair from head to toe. Lying across ways of the ravine were many fallen trees and so this creature was breaking the branches of these trees while running as fast as a deer would be seen running. Which means it was inhumanly fast but very humanly in character.",
