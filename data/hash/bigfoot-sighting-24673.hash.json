  "observed": "In September 1992 my girlfriend spent the night at my house. Around 11:30pm we were bored and so my girlfriend and my two sisters and I decided to sneak out of the house and take a walk around the lake. There were other houses around this lake also.  The skies were clear and the weather was nice.  We got about half way around the lake when I heard something behind me and turned around to see. I was startled to see a big tall hairy thing about 13 feet tall. I saw it walk across the road about 5 feet behind us. I screamed, and my sister who was 13 years old at the time turned and saw it also. My baby sister was too little and can't remember. I don't remember if my girl friend saw it. We took off running and screaming back to our house. We went into my bedroom and were awake the rest of the night afraid to make a move thinking it was still out there. I was 15 years old at the time.",
