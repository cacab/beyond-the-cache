  "observed": "I was going to feed rabbits I raised, when I heard someone walking through the brush, when I  looked I saw a dark figure of what looked like a man. when I said \"hello\" it swayed from side to side and studied me, then began to approach me, I then could see very deep eye sockets oddly shaped, and it was covered in black hair. I turned and ran to the house, no sounds were heard. I was twenty feet or less from the creature when I saw it.",
