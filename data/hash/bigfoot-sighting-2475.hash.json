  "observed": "It was last summer July 1998. I was sleeping when I heard a loud screaming sound I got up to see what it was. I went to my back door and looked out the back  door and I didn't see anything. But I kept hearing this loud scream. So I turned on the light and it stopped. I looked around and didn't see anything. So I went back to bed. Then a few months later I was watching sightings and they played a sound track of a Bigfoot I almost fell out of my chair it was the same scream I had heard in July.  I have moved from that house and live closer to the river Ohio river. But every time I hear that scream IT SENDS CHILLS UP AND DOWN MY BACK . Thanks",
