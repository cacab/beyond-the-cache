  "date": "1994-07-15",
  "observed": "This was years ago, probably 1994 or 95 but I lived in Arbor Glen Estates in Richwood, Kentucky.  Back then it was a relatively new subdivision and our home backed up to a wooded area.  My sighting was in the middle of the day.  I was walking my dog, Charlie in the backyard and all of a sudden she stopped.  I looked around and took note of the fence line right where she was looking and growling.  It was straight in front of us.  The bigfoot was about 50 feet in front of me on the other side of the fence line.  We starred at each other for a few minutes.  I had such a hold on Charlie's leash.  After a few minutes of looking at one another, he turned an ran away.  As soon as he turned, I turned, grabbed the dog and made a run for the house. I looked back just as I was almost in the house and he was gone. I distinctly remember the creature.  He was tall.  Well over 6ft high.  He was an off white color with with fur that dangled a little bit (maybe 3-5 inches in spots).  The face was a mix between human and primate.  Not an ape, not a human dressed up. My father has also seen it.  Off of Shady Lane in Crittenden, Ky. near a creek bed.  Later that night I overheard him telling my mother about it.  Crazy thing is, we seem to have seen the same type of creature.  Both of our sightings were tall creatures and off white.",
