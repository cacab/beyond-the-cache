  "date": "2008-09-24",
  "observed": "September 24, 2008 reporting sound from Prescott, AZ. 09/24/09, 11:30 p.m. My wife and I were sitting in our bedroom with the bedroom window open, we were working on papers for our personal budget when we heard a howl that lasted for quite some time, this occurred several times within a 5 minute time frame. The sound was so out of the ordinary that both my wife and I stopped what we were doing and looked out the window and listened to the howl. Both my wife and I have heard many animals from enjoying the outdoors such as elk, coyotes, deer, and bear, but this howl we could not place. When the howls ocurred the dogs in the neighborhood all started barking. The howls seemed to be coming from quite a distance but they were still very noticable. We live in a quiet rural neighborhood where the elevation is approxiametly 6000' with lots of pine, oak, juniper, and lots of  brush. If I were to guess at where the sounds were coming from I would guess from a higher elevation, but not sure. Several days later I had remembered hearing about your web-site and remembered the sound potion of it, so my wife and I listened to the sound tracks and feel that the howls on your web-site and the howls we heard sounded eerily similar.",
