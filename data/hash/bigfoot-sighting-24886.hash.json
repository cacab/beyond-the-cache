  "observed": "My friends and i were camping on Mt. Graham, around the ******* [place name removed by editor] area. I was raised in that area as a child and I came back to visit with some long time friends that remain living in the safford, Az area. We were up for the weekend doing the usual camping thing in close vicinity of *******.  It was about 0100-0130 time frame, when all six of us heard some very weird sounds that sounded like no other thing I have ever heard, mind you I was a infantry soldier for 13 years, always out in the wilderness and never once have I heard something so freaky. I was kinda worried, but we all laughed it off and got back to our conversation. Not a hour later, we heard it again, really loud and really mad sounding, whatever it was. It was very close, like right behind us breaking branches and making those crazy sounds. My buddy got into his truck and turned the headlights on. It quit. We all slept in our vehicles that night. The next morning there were broken branches behind us, big thick ones to the size of baseball bats, really weird. I don't know what it was, but my one friend said he has been on this site before and it sounded like one recording that is on this site.",
