  "title": "Daylight sighting by backpacker near Pacific Crest Trail west of Independence observes two creatures during the afternoon on the PCT",
  "date": "2008-10-27",
  "observed": "Very visual on 8-11-07 at 2:P.M. in southern high sierras along the P.C.T. At 200 yards I watched 2 bigfoot for 10 minutes just walking around within 25 feet of each other by the edge of a deep canyon. After 10 min. I gave them this coyote call I have and within 2-3 seconds they were both gone down into that canyon. No pictures were taken, because my mind \"FROZE\". So, on 8-6-08 I went back to the exact same place, and found only one thing to bring back home. A chunk of big foot poop the size of a golf ball. Similar to horse poop but definitely NOT horse. So after two years in a row I will go back, as a 3rd time is a CHARM. (Video Camera next time)",
