  "observed": "While riding our bike just after sundown my dogs started going crazy, I looked at my dogs and saw that the hair on their backs was straight up.  I looked in the direction they were barking and standing in a suger beet field thirty to forty feet away was a humanoid figure covered in long shaggy grey hair.  This thing was massive and I would imagine it was at least eight feet tall.  It didn't move - it just stood there looking at us.  Needless to say in 1962 I didn't know what bigfoot was so I turned my bike around and got the hell out there. My dogs a collie and an Australian shepherd beat me home.",
