  "date": "1957-09-18",
  "observed": "In 1957 in Valentine, NE I was 6 years old and playing hide and seek...I was with another young girl and we were walking down an alley looking for the other kids when we saw a sasquatch coming down the alley toward us..it was very tall and looked like a erect ape..very hairy...and was making terrifying loud noises.  We went running for the hills.  I carried the memory for many years and have never doubted that this was a true sighting.  The only person that believed was a school teacher that lived on that street who heard the inhuman sounds it was making.",
