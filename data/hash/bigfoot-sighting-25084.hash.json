  "title": "Deer hunter observes tall bi-pedal creature running on the other side of a dry riverbed outside Wellman",
  "date": "2006-11-15",
  "observed": "I was hunting in my uncles timber. The time was about 5:30 so I decided to head out. I was walking back to my truck following a well traveled trail and heard a noise on the north side of the dried up river bed. I looked over and drew my gun thinking it might be a deer. as i followed it with my scope, I noticed it was way bigger than a deer. It probably stood 2 foot taller than a deer or human. It was sollid black, covered in hair, and was running away from me at an incredible speed. the reason i'm saying that is because it was in dense brush. i got scared, because i couldnt explain what i had just seen. so i ran to my truck and left.",
