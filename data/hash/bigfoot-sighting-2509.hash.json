  "observed": "My name is Todd Davis.   Myself and a freind \"Brian J.\" went camping at Wilson Island State Park. This park is connected to Desoto Bend National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa. Well here is my account of what happened. It was aproximately 2:55 am when I was awakened by the sound of footsteps in the dry leaves. It circled my tent then stopped directly behind my head. Being half awake I assumed it was my friend Brian getting up to go to the bathroom in the bushes. But then I heard the sound of Brian unzipping his tent and so I realized it wasn' Brian. When I jumped up to go outside of my tent, what ever it was standing behind my tent took off, plowing through the trees heading to the Missouri River, which was about 300 meters from our camp site. Anyway when we both climbed out of our tents, we were afraid, because Brian thought I was walking around his tent trying to scare him. When we realized we were both inside our tents at the same time it gave us a very spooky feeling. I guess what bothered us the most was that we were the only people in the campground. We pondered the possibility of it being a hunter, but why would a hunter be out at 2:55am in a state park? Well, neither one of us saw anything but I have never felt like that before. The whole night we both felt like we were being watched.",
