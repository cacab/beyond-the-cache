  "observed": "I have reported before on this website. I live in a rural area in west-central Indiana. I have heard strange primate-like calls coming from the woods behind my residence for about eighteen months. About two weeks ago, I heard powerful whooping calls coming from our woods as I was changing a tire on my car at about 10PM. These calls were followed by wood knocks. The calls sounded like those I have heard on this site. I have been an amateur bigfoot researcher for many years, and am convinced that one, possibly more, are inhabiting the woods behind my house.",
