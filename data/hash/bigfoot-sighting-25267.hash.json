  "title": "Memory told of a sasquatch standing in headlights on Christmas Eve west of St. Jacob",
  "date": "1980-12-24",
  "observed": "It was Xmas eve 12/24/1980 app. 7:00pm. It was very very cold. I had just turned onto IL. R.R. 4  4 heading north and was picking up speed when I saw something in the middle of the road. There was no other cars in the area so i turned my bright lites on and started hitting my brakes. As I got closer i saw a bigfoot just standing in the middle of the road looking at me as if it was blinded by my headlights. I came to almost a complete stop as I looked at it and moved the car into the opposite lane to avoid hitting it. I came within inches of it and was looking at it the whole time. It was standing up but seemed to be kind of bent over at the waist and its was holding its right arm up against its chest (like if you would have your arm in a sling). I estimate it was well over 7 foot tall-(at the time i had a brother 6'8\" and I know it was much taller than he was). I keep saying it because I'm not sure of its sex. I was in amazement and not sure what to do. I decided to go to the next road and turn around but it was gone when I returned (app.1-1/2 -2 minutes later). The best I can remember the temp. Was around 0-fr. Or below. This is a very rural area and there is no reason anyone would be standing in the middle of the road on Xmas eve in that kind of weather dressed up like a bigfoot - esp. Who's that tall to begin with? I am a hunter and have spent many hours in the wood but, have never seen anything like that before or after.",
