We were just talking about things girls and such when one of my friends let us know that he heard something we just laughed at him ,about 2 or three minutes later 2 of my friends claimed to have heard the same noise so the two of us that did not here it started making fun of them. about 5 minutes after that our dogs started pacing back and forth and acting strange. then all at once a loud yell came from behind the leanto and it shook hard i could see it visably shaking we all ran except for one and he froze and could not move. we ran through the pitch black woods hitting trees and running through briars. when we got out of the woods we turned and noticed that our friend was not with us we yelled for him and about 2 minutes later he came out of the woods carrying his collie in his arms. I never knew what this thing was but my friend said that he could not see it but that he could here it behind him making a grunting sound as he sat in front of the fire and he could hear it behind him walking as he walked out of the woods some distance behind him. we went back the next day with an adult to retrieve our sleeping bags and things and our leanto had been torn down the rocks we had for the fire pit was scattered.the whole area smelled 10 X's worse than a wet dog.(when this thing yelled from behind our leanto it was super loud as if someone had loud speakers behind our leanto)",
