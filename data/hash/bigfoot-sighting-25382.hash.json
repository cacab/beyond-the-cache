  "observed": "On January 28, 2009 I was hunting on a strip of public land in north-east iowa.  It was around 5:30 pm. just before dark.  I came across a set of tracks coming out of a thicket and heading across an alfalfa field that I was walking. At first, I didn't think nothing of it, others hunt that area.  As I took a break to catch my breath from walking. I noticed that the space between the tracks were freakishly large.  The snow was any where from ankle deep to knee deep.  I could take 4 - 4 1/2 steps in between its two.  I'm around 5'9\" and in that snow I can't see any man even running make that stride.  All the Tracks were in a perfect straight line.  -  -   -   -   -   - That's what the tracks looked like being spaced around 5 1/2 to 6 feet apart.  Humans as far as I know walk with staggered footprints.  I'm 28 years old and got started hunting at a very young age, thanks to my dad.  I also have a degree in environmental science. I know animal tracks and I've came across many human tracks before and nothing compares to this.  At the time the tracks looked to be 2-4 days old.",
