  "observed": "Maybe nothing, but, my wife and I were camped in Fiddler Gulch, (Lat 42.220218 Lon -123.748328 deg.), over the weekend of June 15th, 2008. Several times we heard what sounded like a branch hitting a tree. The sound was the same each time, two cracking sounds spaced about two seconds apart. My wife thinks that the sound may have been heating or cooling of a burnt out tree, cracking as it expands or contracts. We were in the Biscuit fire area. There was not much of a breeze to cause branch movement, so not likely wind. The sound was two measured beats, and was heard just once or twice morning and evening.",
