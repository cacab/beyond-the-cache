  "observed": "I was sitting by the fire, boiling sap from maple trees.  I went behind a shed, it was 1:30 AM with 3/4 of a moon.  I looked to the east toward the water and seen a tall shadow walk by about 7' tall walking down a new gravel road they had put in.  I watched this shadow for about 30 seconds until it disappeared into the darkness.  When it walked it wobbled from side to side moving real slow.",
