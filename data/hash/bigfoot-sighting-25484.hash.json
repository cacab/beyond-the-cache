  "observed": "At about 2 am I woke up and went downstairs to get a drink  of milk because I had leg cramps. While standing at the kitchen island counter I noticed movement at the kitchen window directly in front of me. I saw what looked like a face look around the side of the window with 2 large red glowing eyes. I was so startled I dropped down behind the counter with my cat and when I peaked over the eyes were gone. I walked over to the spot light switch for the back yard flipped it on but didn't see anything.It may have moved back to the side of the window where I couldn't see it.",
