  "observed": "I was on travel for my job and staying at Colorado Springs for several weeks. It was the middle of September, on a Saturday morning. The day before it had rained hard, then that night it cleared off and got down near freezing. I got up early that Saturday and decided to go exploring. I drove over to the Florissant Fossil Beds. It is a pretty isolated area. It was early in the morning about 8:00 and I was the first visitor to the site. I got there right when the park ranger opened the gate. Just he and I were the only ones there. The ranger told me that I should go on the nature trail through the park. It was a self guided tour. The trail is a dirt trail. I got probably 3/4 of a mile and the path got soft. The rain the day before had washed the mud on the path smooth. I noticed at that time that a herd of elk had come on to the path from the right, some time that night after it rained and followed the path for approximately 50 feet. They then exited into the forest on the left. I got to looking at the track closer and noticed that on top of the elk track were a set of large 16\" barefoot prints following the elk. I thought it was odd that somebody would be out walking around that night before barefooted and in the mud. I continued on the path and it looped back to the ranger station. I still was the only visitor when I arrived back there. I asked the ranger who would be out there barefooted in this temperature. He laughed and said bigfoot.",
