  "observed": "I was kayaking with a friend in econlockhatchie river in orange county the east side of orlando fl it was 2003 early spring or very late winter my friend was much slower than me so I was having fun suprising these very large alligators that were sunning them selves in the early morning sun.The river is very narrow and has tight winding corners which allowed me to pop around a corner and to my delight most of the time a huge gator would slip into the river silently I would glide over the spot thinking that gator has to be lurking on the bottom.Anyway The wind was light out the west very dry and cool a real treat for a floridian I paddled a ways on a strait with the wind blowing from the woods to the water when I smelled such a strong overwhelming oder musty thick moist pugent smell I never experienced before I looked to see what on eart could it be when I saw big patch of long flowing fur it was shiny and light brown and moving fast then this animal crashed through the woods with so much force that small trees were popping and snapping as it ran away from me and the river then that smell was lingreing over the area and was so strong I finnaly held my breath and had paddle to get some fresh air.I had heard that bigfoot smelled like that but I had no idea they had been reported in fl.Anyway I had watched monster quest for years and not one person ever mentioned the smell I only remember it from seventies on tv when i was very young I never reported this til now because I felt  stupid and confused then after watching tonights episode where 2 different reports described that same smell I felt compelled also the location seemed very odd orlando fl just seemed too odd but internet searches showed many reports",
