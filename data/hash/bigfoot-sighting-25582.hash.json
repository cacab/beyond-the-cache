  "date": "2009-03-05",
  "observed": "the date: 3/5/2009 time: 12:00AM Place: In Pasco County going down Gulf Trace towards US Highway 19. I was just going over the bridge close to the Holiday Recreational Center. Well just over the bridge the road curves slightly then straightens out, I had my high beams on like I always do when I pass a wooded area (I am a strong believer in Bigfoot) to try and catch a glimps of the sasquatch, Well that night it paid off! What I saw was a figure about 8 and a half to 9 feet tall and was hair covered, my light had made his eyes glare and he kinda squinted his eyes a little due to the light I am guessing. And I supposed I surprised it as it appeared to be just making its way walking out of the tree line towards the road and thats were I saw him, he stopped instantly when my light hit him (I saw him instantly, as well I slowed down)he backed up into the tree line more and just watched me in a seemingly very curious manner. at that point I had been stopped and due to the angle of my lights not being directly on him anymore, just the peripheral of my lights were on him, all I could see was from his shoulders up. I was speechless and for some reason I called out saying \"Hi!\" and at that point he backed up out of the light and I could hear running off into the woods. I stayed a few more moments and continued on my way. the entire incident from start to end only lasted about a minute thirty. END REPORT",
