  "observed": "2007 I was hunting on my hunting club land,when some people were shooting guns nearby.I had been watching a greenfield that was on a powerline.The people were hooping and hollering after they shot.It was about 5pm,I had gotten disgusted and was fixen to leave.They were shooting to my far right.I could hear them talking clearly.One of them shot and let out a whoop afterwards.Thats when to my left sort of in front of me I heard a response.It was a loud long whoop,followed by a chatter.I thought it was just the echo of the person.Then it did it again,this time it was further up from my left.I began to watch the tree line and the field.Thats when I could see something on two legs walking in the pines.It was about 200 yards to my left,heading for a break in the pines.Then it stopped and crouched down.A cold chill began to run up my back.Thinking it was another hunter I stood up and began to move. It did'nt move it just sat there by a brush pile.I have been interested in bigfoot for a longtime.I began to walk towards my truck,but it still would'nt move.I returned the next day to look for sign but found nothing.The only thing I noticed was an unusual odor,kind of like a wet deer.Only thing was it had'nt rained in days.I hav'nt said anything till I found your website and saw the eyewitness account in franklin county alabama.",
