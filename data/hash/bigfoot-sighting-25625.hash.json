  "title": "Man finds large, human-like footprints in mud while jogging near his home (photos included)",
  "date": "2009-02-20",
  "observed": "Was out for a run a couple of weeks ago and during my cool down I noticed what might be footprints in some dried mud. I have pictures and will send them if needed, most of the area is flat with some surrounding hills and low trees (juniper, oak, ect.). I'm unsure whether or not these are actual tracks due to the many other obvious boot and shoe prints in the same area; but, a few of the tracks have what looks like toe impressions and all are fairly large. All were bigger than my size 13 shoe, there is also a sighting reported in the same area on this website, October 2006 Navajo County, AZ near Cibecue. I live right behind the school and about 1/2 mile away from the old airport and have heard numerous stories, including one about two months before of three people seeing one sasquatch cross the road, and people seeing a sasquatch near the school dumpsters.",
