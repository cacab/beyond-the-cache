  "observed": "My husband and I live in Sautee, Ga., just outside of Helen. My husband can't sleep very well at night and as such he is up at all hours. For about the last three weeks he has heard strange sounds late at night. He has got me up several times to listen. Whatever we are hearing is not anything we have heard before. All of the dogs go crazy and whatever it is seems to move very quickly, attracting the dogs as it goes. It is very loud and it more of a howl or scream; it does not sound like a bobcat or bear or anything else we have heard since living in Northeast Ga. We have lived in this area for nine years and my husband has hunted all his life and is used to sounds in the night, just not this one. When he woke me up to hear this we jokingly said \"maybe it's a bigfoot\". I got curious as to whether or not there had been any sightning in our area and found this website. After reading reports from this area I thought that maybe we had heard something out of the ordinary, hence the report.",
