  "observed": "May 17, 2009 Tonight at the cowlitz barrier dam Myself and two friends where sitting in a drift boat on the south side of the cowlitz river about 150 yrds below the boat launch. At about 8:15 PM On the North side of the river near the top of the cliff A sound very much like a chimp screaming began wailing high on the steep face in very dense brush directly across the river from us. The sound carried on wailing and screaming intermittently  for a minute or more and then stopped. We could not see anything at all making the noise. My partners said they had never heard such a thing before. However I heard the exact same thing a few years ago back behind the Salkum graveyard. At that time I was sure that the only thing that would make a noise like a chimp screaming would be bigfoot and I cannot imagine what else it could be.",
