I THEN LOOKED TOWARDS THE WOODLINE AND COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING I LOOKED AT MY NEIGHBORS HOMES AND ALL THE LIGHTS WERE OFF , I THEN SAID TO MY SELF ,  SOMEBODY IS MESSING WITH ME , I WAITED ABOUT TEN SECONDS AND I TRIED TO YELL BACK LIKE THE HOWL I HEARD AND IMMEDIATELY HEARD SOMETHING IN THE WOODS HOWL BACK BUT IT WAS CLOSER , I WAS THEN VERY SCARED, AND I PULLED OUT A GUN I WAS CARRYING AND WALKED BACKWARDS TO MY HOUSE . THIS THING IN THE WOODS HOWLED AND STOPPED THEN A SECOND ONE HOWLED AND STOPPED NOT MOORE THEN 75 FEET AWAY. THE HOWLING LASTED ABOUT 15 SECONDS ( THE WHOLE TIME I WAS WALKING BACKWARDS TOWARDS MY HOUSE )THE WHOLE TIME I WAS WALKING AWAY I NEW WHAT EVER WAS MAKING THAT SOUND WAS VERY BIG AND I WAS VERY SCARED, (I DONT SCARE EASY , IM A 6 FOOT 300LB MAN )  I WENT INSIDE MY HOME AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW FOR A WHILE AND NEVER HEARD OR SEEN ANYTHING AFTER I GOT INSIDE . I WOKE UP MY WIFE THE NIGHT THIS HAPPENED AND ASKED HER IF ANY APES HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE ZOO OR CIRCUS THAT I MIGHT OF MISSED ON THE NEWS AND SHE SAID NO .I DIDNT THINK  AT THE TIME THE HOWL I HEARD WAS A BIGFOOT UNTIL I HEARD SOME SOUND CLIPPINGS AND READ MY NEIGHBORS REPORT NUMBER 14887.
