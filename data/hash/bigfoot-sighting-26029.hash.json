  "observed": "I was 15 years old visiting my grand parents up from Miami Fla, while on a walk through a remote forest section of lake Keowee SC at twilight I saw a very large shape walk up a section from the lake about a 20% incline from left to right across a dirt road and into the dense forest at a higher elevation to the right.  I was approx  50 yards away when it saw me the light was very low but I saw this thing was not human at all, at least 7 to 8 ft tall 450, lbs no neck and reddish in color. I bolted in a panic this thing ran up the hill and started to parrallel the road in which I running I will never forget the scream it let out the cove was like an ampatheater, but it sounded like a cow and a pig being killed on a rock concert sound system. afterwords many people my pastor among many  indicated that this creature had been seen and heard for many years in the area, I am now am a airline captain ex fighter pilot and hold a degree in zooology, one night I was watching monsterquest and heard a bigfoot scream my girlfriend said I turned white and started to shake. this thing is real, no question about it.",
