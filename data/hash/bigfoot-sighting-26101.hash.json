  "title": "Teacher sees a bigfoot cross the highway in front of her near Aberdeen",
  "date": "1995-01-15",
  "observed": "I was driving home in January of 1995 from Aberdeen, Washington to Westport, at around 9:00pm on State Hwy 105.  It was dark, foggy and kind of misty.  I was approx. one mile from the Stafford Creek Correctional Facility, on a long straight uphill  stretch of the road.  The lights of the prison turnoff were backlighting the crest of the hill.  There were no other cars of the road.  The road is a two lane road, with wide shoulders that could easily be additional lane width, so in essence the road is 4 lanes wide. I could easily see the road due to the backlighting and my headlights and foglights on my car. When I was about half way the hill, a figure stepped onto to the road from the bank, moving from the south to the north.  The north would lead to the harbor.  This figure was quite large, larger than any man that I have ever seen.  He had a large rounded head shape, long arms that reached well below his waist line.  His strides were huge.  He swung his arms opposite of the feet he was moving.  He cleared the roadway in 2 strides, and moved into the brush on the bayside of the road.  I could not make out any physical details or features of this figure other than the ones I have described. I could and still do each time I go past this location, look to see if the animal path that he was following is still there, and it is. For a long time I kept quite about this.  I am not who likes to be in the public eye.  But now that I have shared this with some friends, they encouraged me to report this sighting.",
