  "observed": "My name is [omitted]. My ex-husband and I were going west on Highway 91 toward Mesquite, Nevada. The wind was blowing south to north. Tumbleweeds had been blowing across the road before.  He came up from the south by the Santa Clara River.  We saw him in our headlights.  He was about in the middle of the road when we saw him.  He was swinging his arms like a human and he kept glancing back to see how fast we were apporaching.  He was  8 to 10 feet tall, had a hairy body and looked like the ones I have seen on TV.  His hair was brown in color.  His hair was blowing in the wind, and we did not feel any fear.  The speed limit in this area is 45 MPH.  Ray slowed down to about 25 MPH.  We did not even talk to each other until we got past him.  Then we each said \"what did you just see\"?  We got to see him for a long time because the road was quite wide and it took quite a while before he went of the shoulder and down a small embankment.",
