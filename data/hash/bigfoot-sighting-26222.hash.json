  "observed": "July 1995 and it didn't really occur to me until some years later what we saw may have been. Myself and a friend were driving from Grand Forks, BC to Republic, Washington to do some shopping. It was early afternoon and I was the driver. I don't remember exactly, but I know it was shortly after we crossed the border on Highway 21 in Washington state. About 1/4 mile in front of us, something dashed across the highway. It came out of dense forest from the west and ran across the road heading east into more dense forest. I remember it being hair covered and dark brown to black. It didn't look like a bear because it was to lean and long. It was running partially on two legs and all four legs. There were no distinct pointed ears that I could see and thought it was too dark in color and too large to be a cougar. We both didn't even consider a sasquatch at the time and figured it was a mutation of some sort of animal. Not until years later as I read more on the internet did I entertain the idea it may have been something else. Nothing distinct I can tell you otherwise, but what I know of wildlife it was NOT a bear, cougar, deer, elk, moose; at least not what you would normally expect them to look like. The encounter lasted only moments as it dashed across the road in front of us. I can't be sure of the distance I mentioned, close enough for me to see the color and shape.",
