  "observed": "while camping in the Lake Luzerne/4th lake area we heard several hoot-whoops on July 24th at approx 0130--200.prior to hearing these whoops, I heard something large walking approx 20-30 ft away from our camp. a distinctive \"cracking\" noise was made as if something very large either broke or stepped on a large branch these vocalizations were between 2, and possibly a 3rd animal. they were heard moving away from our area. I almost wonder if they were herding prey for hunting purposes. approx 02 hrs later I heard them again as they moved back into our area.I have heard these noises before and I immediately recognized the sounds as they are so unique.there were 7 people in our tent. 4 teenage girls (my wife myself and our 10 month old son.we all heard them and needless to say the girls and my wife were a little startled.",
