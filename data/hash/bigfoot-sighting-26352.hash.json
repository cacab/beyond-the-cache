She lives with me though, and can be reached at the info i will leave later. The occurance happen several years ago in a rural locaion close to our home. My mom was on her way home from a friends house that lives only a short drive from our home. It was late afternoon and she was coming around a curve in the road, when a tall (6-7) ft tall hairy biped slowly crossed the road in front of her car, almost causing her to wreck. She said it looked like a bear on two legs walking, with the face of a gorilla. The animal walked directly in front of the car without seeming to get in any hurry, even though she had to slam on the breaks to keep from hitting it. She said it only looked back at her once and never stoped walking.It then disappeared into the woods by a lake.",
