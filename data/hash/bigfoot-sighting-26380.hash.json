  "observed": "My wife and I were riding an ATV about one mile from an abandoned strip mine.We came up over a small hill and approx.25 - 30 yards in front of us and to the right of the trail stood a solid black creature,approx.8 - 9 feet tall standing behind a tree that was only about 8 - 10 inches wide.I saw the creature first and my wife didn't notice it until I suddenly stopped the ATV and was trying to get it in reverse to turn around. She ask me what I was doing. I said look standing over there.When she saw the creature she started screaming Oh my god no no no no.I finally got the ATV turned around and left the area as fast as the ATV would run.My wife kept looking behind us to see if the creature was following us.Thank god it did not,but i still did not slow down until we were about two miles from the sighting area.I have totally lost intrest in outdoor activites that I once loved due to this experience.",
