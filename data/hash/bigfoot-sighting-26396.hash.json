  "title": "Possible daylight sighting of a juvenile sasquatch on all fours by a deer hunter near Axson",
  "date": "2007-11-15",
  "observed": "I was in South Georgia at a Hunting Camp I had just joined that year.  I was leaving the camp site and driving throught the planted pines (maintained dirt roads) to go to my stand.  Directly behind camp is approx 30 - 50 acres that no one is allowed to hunt for safety purposes.  There is also a small pond in this area.  Driving about 1/4 mile from camp, I looked to my left in the pines and noticed something black.  I was approaching an intersection, so I slowed to see what would emerge from the woods.  To my surprsie, a black \"animal\" came out of the woods on all fours, angled 45 degrees away from me.  I tried to convince myself I was seeing a bear, or possibly a cow that got loose.  However, as I watched from 50 feet I noticed the complete absence of a tail.  I watched the animal in the open road, in broad day light for 10 seconds.  It came directly out of the woods, and ran down the road then crossed into the opposing woods and disappeared.  I could see that the rear legs appeared longer than the front, and the head was closer to the ground.  Also, as it ran on all fours the animal loped, with the slope of the back changing rather than remaining level.  As if the front was bouncing.  Further, the legs and rear were much too thin to be that of a bear.  Though I did not see the \"face\" - from the limited sight of the head, there were no clearly visible ears.  A bear's ears would be clearly visible.  I immediately thought of Sasquatch, however I was seeing an animal running on all fours... I have just seen the Jacobs photo - and that is the best way I can describe what I saw in South Georgia.",
