  "date": "2009-08-25",
  "observed": "At precisely 1:30 am, on the 25 of August 2009. I was driving a 18 wheeler on CR.196 which runs off of FM.416 in Freestone county Texas. I had just driven about 100 meters on a oil field lease road, when I spotted what I thought was a large Russian boar hog on the right side of the lease road about 75-100 feet in front of me. What really caught my eye was that it had a really big head covered with long bushy hair. I'd been driving about 20 mph before I saw it, but as soon as I saw it, I slowed down to maybe 5 mph. At this time, it stood up on it's hind legs and looked directly at me and growled at me as if it were a wolfman like in the old 50's movies.Then it ran on its hind legs like a human being, but faster than anything I've ever seen in my life; across the road in front of me, and into a tree line. I was in a 18 wheel Mack truck and this thing stood so tall as to look at me eye to eye.I've worked in the oil field for years and I've seen hogs of all sizes and breeds.Thousands of deer, and even black panthers.But this was something different, almost un-natural.  I've never been more afraid in my life,than during the time I saw it and while I was performing the job I sent to do.",
