  "observed": "Im writing this for my Father,he is 69yrs old he doesnt have the internet. I got a call from my dad telling me he just saw \" Harry\"! (sounded really excited)I said who? he said the Big guy. I knew who he was talking about right away. This wasnt the 1st time,this was his 2nd sighting in 5yrs. This is what happened: My dad and his wife were sitting in front of their big bay window around 6:45 watching the deer grazing before the sun was going down. The deer were feeding for a good 20 to 30 mts. and then my dad and his wife noticed the deer got spook by something and ran off. They thought maybe a wolf, coyote or a hunter scared them off. Then my dads wife notice something walking across the field,they thought maybe it was a hunter for sure with dark brown or dark heavy clothes on. She grab their binoculars to get a better look, cos it was walking weird and it seem really tall about 6 ft to 7 ft tall and my dad was trying to get a good look without the binoculars and could tell it didnt look human. They both got uneasy feeling. They said whatever it was walking casually,can see the dark fur,walking upright and it was walking thru the field and stop and bent over a couple of times and maybe looking for food. Then  it walked into the woods. They didnt hear anything weird after that. It was already dark. About 7:15pm He told me, a few nights ago he smelt a skunky musty smell in the air and also getting uneasy feelings every time he would go out to his backyard which leads into woods. Like he was being watched. He heard weird howling noises too for few nights ago.",
