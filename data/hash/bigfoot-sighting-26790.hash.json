  "observed": "While driving down a dirt road which ran alongside a small lake looking for a place to fish I saw something standing in the grass beside a small tree. I stopped my car to get a good look. It appeared to have the shape and look of a person but very tall,muscular and covered in what looked to be brown fur,simular to the color of the fur of a deer. I believe it must have been 7-8 feet tall. It didn't move but just stood looking at me . I got spooked when the friend in the back seat said he seen it move and I took off in a hurry. I went back to the spot of the sighting in the daytime a couple days later but didn't find tracks or anything else.",
