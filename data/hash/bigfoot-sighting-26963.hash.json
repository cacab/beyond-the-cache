  "observed": "This is the story as was relayed to the investigator. \"Just after dark the witness, which was 15 at the time, and his friend were getting nightcrawlers to go fishing with. Just behind their house, which like many West Virginia houses is rural, their was an old logging road which was covered by very heavy green briars. The witness heard something coming down the mountain through the green briars. He shined his flashlight and saw an enormous animal which was built like a large bodybuilder. He watched the animal from 60 feet away traveling right to left. He watched the animal for several seconds. What stuck out his memory the most was the swinging arms and the hair 10-12 inches long hanging down off of the forearms. The hair in general was mostly straight and dark brown in color with reddish tinge on tips. It really scared his friend and him. The next day based on a sapling they estimated the animal to be 9 feet tall.\"",
