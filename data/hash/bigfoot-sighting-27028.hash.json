  "observed": "Early Summer 2004: One morning at 3 am I heard a vocalization at what I thought was quite a ways off. Now, looking back at the situation, I was in the house and heard it clearly. I have no idea of the distance. But it was definately the whoop howl that is recorded here on your website. November 2004: I saw something big on two legs run through my yard one night. The ground was frozen, so no tracks. It was big is all I can say. (Original report edited by the investigator to add the date notations.)",
