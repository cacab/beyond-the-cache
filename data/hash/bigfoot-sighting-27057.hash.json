  "date": "2009-06-10",
  "observed": "in early june of this year i was riding my four wheeler above jasper colorado , at about 7;00 in the morning, i had stopped to rest at the logging block, when i heard a loud howling noise. there was no wind that day, and i could not focus in on the source. i had seen alot of sheep on Cornwall mountain on the way up so i figured it was a dog  or the sheep hearder, when i had finished my water i was loading everthing back on the bike,when i heard the same sound again, only this time it was much louder. i zeroed in on it and my heart stopped. slightly below my logging road and to my right i observed a very large dirty black man like creature with his hands around an aspen tree,it was leaning a little to the right and staring at me. i stood very still and never took my eyes off of it.after about seven or eight minutes it turned and simply walked off down the hill.i will add that i am a 30 year archery hunter, and have succesfully tagged bears in this same unit. this was no bear. it was large and shaggy looking.",
