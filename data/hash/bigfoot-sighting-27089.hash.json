  "title": "Nighttime sighting at City Lake Park outside Sullivan",
  "date": "2009-10-15",
  "observed": "This past October I was walking along Mattox Dr, by City Lake Park in Sullivan Missouri. It was around 11, 11 20 PM on a Thursday night and the park is remote and empty on a night like that. I am 29 and stand 6 foot 6 inches. My vision is 15/20 in my left eye, better than normal. As I came around the curb, I had the National Preserve, Meramec State Park to my right. As I looked ahead some 70 to 100 feet and I saw this tall monkey with long legs go by under one of the lights. I immediately looked to my right at the three line as fear overwhelmed my body. I turned around, pacing myself back towards town, trying to make sense of what I saw. It stood about 7 feet, and it was hairy, the hair of the arms was hanging 3, to 4 inches, it was the only part of the silhouette that was clearly hairy and I could notice clearly that it had ape like hairy arms. I went back to the house and researched the subject on you tube, but most of the videos showed a much heavier set creature. A lot of people that I talked to just can not believe me. Last night I came across the Jacobs video and the similarity struck me. I know that is hard to believe what I saw and I myself was a skeptic of this phenomenon, until it happened to me. Now I know that the creature in cause exists. Do we know why it is so elusive? It seams that it was leaving the park when it saw me? Why would a creature so large be scared of a human? I have no intention to gain any benefit from my experience. Thank you.",
