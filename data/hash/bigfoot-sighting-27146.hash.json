  "observed": "Late October, 2009 a friend and I was hunting for deer looking for tracks. We came across a bare footprint. Didn't really think much about it at the time. On Jan 5, 2010 we went hunting my friend dropped me off at a house that sits on the property, that no-one lives at. He dropped me off at 6.15 am, while I was getting suited up, I heard the lowest growl I have ever heard in my life. Almost so low that the ground shook. Anyway when I heard the growl I turn my flashlight in that direction. There are horses in that field, they were running and their eyes were full of fear. Well I continued to my stand and about thirty minutes later heard a single wood knock from 3 different directions. On top of that also heard what sounded like screech owls coming from same directions as the knocks. On Jan 11, 2010 my friend and I went to go shoot our guns with his son and nephew. My friends stand sit about 50 yards of the road with a fence about 40 yards away. We found track that come right up to the fence and stop then go back across the dirt road and that's where I heard the growl. The print were 21 inches long 4 inches at heel and 7 inches at the toes.",
