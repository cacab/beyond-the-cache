  "observed": "I left my parents house on my way back to NAS Lemoore, Ca. As my buddy and I were heading towards Gorman on 138 (Lancaster Road)between 200th street west and 280th street west, we both saw something to our right running through the desert. It had to have been 7 plus feet tall, thin and long stringy hair hanging off its body. Arms seemed long with a long stride. I didn't believe what I saw, about a minute later my buddy asked if I had seen something, I said yes. He then described exactly what I saw. It was dark and it really spooked us. We took off quick, to this day I know I saw something and it puts a chill down both our spines when we talk about it. Friends and family think I'm crazy, I know what I saw. Being much older now, I wish I would have gone back for proof, foot prints or something.",
