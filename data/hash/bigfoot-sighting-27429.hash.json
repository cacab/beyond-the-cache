  "observed": "Incident happened at around 5:30 p.m., Wednesday, March 10, 2010.   I was on County Road J, somewhere between Harrisville, WI and Princeton, WI.  Exact location unknown, because I was kind of just following the car in front of me, driving on \"auto pilot.\"  It was very foggy and we were both going about 30-35 mph.  Suddenly, the car in front of me slammed on the brakes, and I did the same.  Running across the road in front of the car in front of me, in about only two strides, was a large black figure, about seven feet tall, with long arms; humanoid form, thinner body type.  I can't be sure but I believe it was hair or fur-covered, not clothing. It appeared and disappeared very quickly because of the fog.  When I passed by the area into which it ran, I saw nothing.",
