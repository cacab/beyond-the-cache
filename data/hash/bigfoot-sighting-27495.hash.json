  "date": "2010-03-24",
  "observed": "I was driving towards Show Low on US 60 about 2:00 in the afternoon on March 24th, 2010. I always look out into the trees in hopes of seeing deer and turkeys, but this time I saw something a bit more out of the ordinary. I saw a very large and tall animal which was about the same redish brown color as a Herford cow, standing about halfway behind a large pine tree. Its arm was very long and it was probably 7ft or more in height. I hit the brakes and slowed way down to get a better look and when doing so, it rotated to make itself more hidden from view. It was too large for the tree it was behind, and now it was visible on both sides of the tree. It definately saw me. I couldn't see its eyes, but it kept its head visible to look at me. Cars were coming so I had to move on.",
