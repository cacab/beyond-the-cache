  "observed": "I was rifle deer hunting. Waiting \"on stand\" -watching a mountainside. The \"driver\" (other hunter who was walking the mountainside to drive out a deer to the stander (me). The hunter I was expecting to see was my brother. I had a clear view of the mountainside-there was a lone pine tree with a fallen log in front of it. It was mid-morning, good weather-clear day and view. I was watching the mountainside when it walked into view. I assumed it was my brother because it walked like a man-upright. It was all in brown. In retrospect, I should have realized right away that it wasn't my brother because of the clothing. It stopped beside the tree and stood there. I had the feeling it could see me.  I thought about putting my rifle scope on it, but thought my brother might not appreciate that,so didn't. After a few seconds, it dropped down to all fours & disappeared out of my view. That was when I realized it couldn\"t have been my brother, so I thought it must have been a bear. Then a few minutes later my brother did appear-in the same place-I could tell right away that it was him & what I had seen was a lot bigger and taller. I have never forgotten the incident-although my family and friends all said it was a bear-I have seen lots of bear in my life and I'm sure it wasn't a bear. I thought it was a man when I first saw it. It walked like and stood like a man-thought it was in a brown coverall or something. Never have seen anything like it since.",
