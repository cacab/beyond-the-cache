  "observed": "In the early spring of 1976. I spent the night at a friends house. I decided to walk down an old logging road, to the country store. To get a cup of coffee. The sun was just beginning to shine through the Forest in foggy streaks. As i walked across a crossroads, I turned my head left. And looked down about 200 feet, there walked out of the forest a tall human like creature. The sun hitting it's backside, i could see it had brown reddish hair, that came from it's forehead back down it's whole body. The hair was long, 8 or 10\" and matted. It turned it's head, it's neck about human length. And it did not have to turn it's body to see me. It's face was black and I could not make out any details. It had a long stride, one step onto the middle of the road, the next into the edge of the forest. It was very tall and thin. It's arms swung out below it's knees, as it walked straight and upright like a human. I froze in fear and ran back home in the opposite direction. When I told anyone they just laughed. Even the game warden. But a year later he saw me fishing and told me he got another report 8 miles west with the same description also they smelled it. As they were camping across from the Island county dump. I would love to talk with that game warden or someone else who had the same experience.",
