  "date": "1997-12-30",
  "observed": "My family and I arrived home after sundown and I left my car headlights on to open the door to my house.  We could hear my dog barking and coming toward us when he chased what I at first thought was a man.  When it came around the trees we could see it was dark brown, covered with fur, and running towards the car (which we were still in).  It then veered and ran back into the woods, still followed by our dog. It looked to me to be more of a youth than full grown.",
