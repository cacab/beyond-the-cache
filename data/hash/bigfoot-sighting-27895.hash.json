  "observed": "On June 16 2010 I was with my friend and I heard the dogs barking very loudly.  I went to the living room window and looked out and the dogs were taking off up the driveway which runs west.  I saw what looked like a big person running off down my drive way.  What i saw was a shadow darker than the tree shadow on the ground, it was bigger than a person but i could not tell the exact height.  The next day another friend and I were walking on my farm and we found a footprint in a cornfield east of my house.  We took three pictures of the footprint.",
