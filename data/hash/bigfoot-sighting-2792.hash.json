  "observed": "The incident in question took place in the summer of 1984 when I was 11 years old. It was around ten in the evening and I was watching TV when all of a sudden some noises like that of a grunting dog came near. the living room window was wide open, and I remember being scared at the strange noises.The grunting noises came by the house and I turned in the chair and saw a large dark upright object pass by. The neighborhood dogs went wild, and a foul scent came with the creatures passing. I was extrememly agitated at the view that I got because I knew that it was not a man as it was too large, nor was it a bear because of the way it was walking. There were other sightings that night from the neighbors, and we came to the conclusion that it must have been a Bigfoot. My brother, about five years ago witnessed what he swears to be a Bigfoot while driving down Country Club Road in Minocqua, Oneida County, Wisconsin. I believe that there is such a hominid creature among us. There have been numerous instances in that area where people have claimed to have seen Bigfoot.",
