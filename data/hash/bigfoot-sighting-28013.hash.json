  "observed": "I (BFRO Investigator Andy P.) am submitting this report on behalf of the witness. The witness is an elderly woman who does not have access to a computer. I recorded my interview with her and am posting an excerpt from that interview here in lieu of a written report. She says she was in one of four cars that pulled up to observe what appeared to be a large sasquatch standing next to an abandoned trailer home. The said it was walking near it and looking into the window. She said she was the last one to drive up, and at that point it turned away from the trailer and walked over the road, directly in front of the first car. It then stepped over a barbed wire fence and into the woods. The following is an excerpt from the interview I had with her.  Please note that I have edited this recording to remove personal details of the witness. ======================== Note from Editor Matt Moneymaker She did not collect the names and phone numbers of the other witnesses, so we have no way to get in touch with them other than by posting this report. When multiple witnesses are mentioned in a report, especially a report involving behavior that is rather uncharacteristic of bigfoots (i.e. standing out in the open in daylight for several minutes next to a road, while cars accumulate along the road to observe) it is even more important to corroborate the story with other witnesses.  So if you were one of the other witnesses to this incident, please do contact us at Contact@BFRO.net",
