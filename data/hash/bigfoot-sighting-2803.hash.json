The snow started melting at the time  .There were actual toe prints in the front - a big, a little smaller, etc.   It was shaped exactly like a normal foot but was 15 to 18 inches in lentgh. We had them the whole way around our property.  I walked in the woods days before and it went over my footprints and covered them.  Its stride was about 3 feet apart from left foot to right.",
