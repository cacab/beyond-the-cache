  "observed": "I was 14 years old. had to walk a friend home she spent the night, she had to be home to babysit so her parents could go to work it was 5am and I looked out my bedroom window to see how much it snowed and what I saw still no one believes me. I saw a very large black thing it was bent down looking at something in the snow only 6ft from my window. Street lights were on and also the snow made things lighter. I froze and started crying and begged my friend to look and she was afraid because I was saying some kind of monster was out their, anyway it looked up at me and slowly stood up and took one step toward me and I ran in my brothers room and jumped on his bed begging him to help. He was afraid too so we hid in his closet until my friend's mother was knocking at the door she was mad she didn't come home. No one believed me. It was very tall, body was huge and the eyes just stared at me.",
