  "date": "1983-10-25",
  "observed": "My mother and I were on our way from church. As we drove down T Hwy. we observed a large creature standing in the center of the road. I stopped the car several feet away and it turned and looked at us and then in one big jump went from the middle of the road, over a fence and loped across the field. I hit the gas and got us home and we RAN into the house, locking the door behind us and making sure the windows were locked as well. We were both frightened for months but never saw it again.",
