  "observed": "It happened when my friend and I were 13. When I found out about this website, about 5 years later, I tried to post it on here but something must have gone wrong with the connection or something. Anyway, It was late winter and storming badly outside. We were outside playing, in front of her house and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a huge shadow and I remember saying \"What the hell is that?\" to my friend and before she could respond we both saw the \"BIGFOOT\" running (on two feet) on the side of the road from approx. 50ft away. We thought at first that it must be a very tall human but when it went under the streetlight, we saw fur from head to toe and it was approx. 7 to 9 ft tall. It also was running faster than I have ever seen anything else run. We both stood there in shock, unable to move or speak. I remember trying to scream but nothing came out. After it ran out of sight, we both looked at each other and ran inside to tell her mother, who obviously didn't believe a word of what we were saying. We didn't go back outside afterwards because we were terrified. To this day, we both remember it like it was last night, but no one believes our story.",
