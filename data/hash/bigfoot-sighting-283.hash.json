  "title": "Couple hear sounds and find footprints near Hoodsport",
  "date": "1992-08-29",
  "observed": "On August 29, !992 my husband and I found a series of five footprints in a dried up boggy area, about 1 1/2- 2 miles past Jefferson Lake in the Hamma Hamma Recreation Area in Jefferson Co., Wa. The prints were 19 inches long and 10 inches wide at the ball of the foot. Previous to finding the foot prints we had been about a mile further up the mountain at a small pond. The pond is very secluded and one side, the side across from us was steep bank with thickvegetation. While we sat at the edge of the pond we heard loud brush movement followed y a loud crack as from a large limb breaking. We watched the other side of the pond hoping to see what was making so much noise. Our thoughts were a large animal with as much weight as a bear or elk etc. As we sat, from time to time there would be more rustling of brush followed by the loud crack of a limb breaking but whatever was there never showed itself or left. I sat there for 30 - 45 min. My husband growing bored began working his way around the pond. About half way around he began smelling a strong unpleasant odor. We both felt a strong unease. He came back and we left. We didn't put this incident together with finding the prints a very short time later till after researching the prints we had found and reading about other peoples encounters with bigfoot. After finding the prints, we went to the ranger station in Hoodsport and told the lady there about the prints we had found. She laughed, said (with a wink) that it must have been \"our sasquatch\". We felt a little silly and left. I continued to talk about what we had found to friend who mostly were disbelieving, but my boss at work said that it was too bad I hadn't made a plaster caste of it. I hadn't thought of that! The next Saturday, Sept.5 we bought a bag of plaster and returned. The prints were still undisturbed so we made a caste and also took pictures of the prints.",
