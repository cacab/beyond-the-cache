  "observed": "My wife and I have a cabin just off the Wind River Hwy on Leete Road for weekend and vacation use. Saturday evening we arrived about 8:00 p.m. and after unpacking the car we walked out to road out front of the cabin, and noticed a very heavy musky skunk like odor. Our brown lab \"Sadie\" caught the scent too and started to look around for it, but it seemed to disappear quickly. About one hour later 9:00ish p.m. I stepped outside with my porch with my dog; hoping to see the planet Jupiter, but it was still behind the trees to our south. It was then that behind our property to the east in the direction of County Rd 60 I heard three distinct and loud animal calls that made a Whoo-Up! sound. It sounded like a person trying to imitate a bird call. I have never heard a sound like this ever in my life, and I am familiar with several Pacific Northwest animal sounds. This unnearved me a little, and caught the dog's attention. I quickly moved the dog inside the cabin, and had my wife put on her shoes to come outside and listen. We waited for about 20 minutes, but did not hear the animal calls again. The only sounds we heard then were the neighbors down the road playing some music, and muffled voices. Bigfoot? I don't know. We have used our cabin for 3 years now and never experienced this. Very odd",
