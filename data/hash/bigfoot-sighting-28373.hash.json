  "observed": "Summer 1998 around 2am I saw something that looked like a bigfoot. It had long dangling arms long wispy reddish brown colored hair about 400 lbs hunched back arms swinging. Arms were larger than legs. It wasnt that tall about 5'6-5'7, ran across the street near Hiawatha National Forest 10 miles or so before Brimley Mi. I flashed my lights on it and it stopped looked at me and walked into the woods. I kept driving, then my tire on my car went flat and I drove on it till I got to a tire store station in Brimley Mi. I spent the night in my car and had the station fix it in the am for me. As I didn't have a cell phone and it was 2am and I was a college student at the time. I don't tell many people about this but I think at least one resides in the Hiawatha National Forrest!",
