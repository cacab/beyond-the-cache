  "observed": "At sunset on March 17, 2001, my friend & I were hiking along a creek/log-jam when we heard what sounded like a strange sort of singing in a culvert.  My friend quickly approached the culvert and urged me to join him immediately.  There at the far end of the culvert were 2 ape-like creatures with glowing eyes.  I believe this was my first Bigfoot sighting.  The singing continued, despite our intrusion.  The creatures did not move toward us, and we left in a hurry so as not to disturb them.",
