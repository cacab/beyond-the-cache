  "title": "Hunter experiences eerie silence, foul odor and possible wood knocking in the Cardinal Marsh Wildlife Management Area",
  "date": "2010-10-24",
  "observed": "I didnt actually see anything but I had an unusual odor from upwind of me. It was something I have never smelled before. The closest thing that I can think of is the smell of a dog after it rolls on something dead combined with strong body odor. The source of the smell was definatley moving, as I could tell it was stronger on my right side first then to my left later. About an hour and a half later i heard what can only be described as two small logs being hit together, whop-whop. That happend twice with about five min. in between.",
