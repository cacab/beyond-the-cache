  "observed": "Back in the summer of 1990 (I cannot recall the exact date), I was on a camping trip with my girlfriend. We had set up camp earlier that day and were getting ready to start cooking some dinner. I'm not sure of the exact time but it was just before nightfall. We were not camped close to anybody because for some reason the campgrounds were empty. I think the nearest people were a family that were camped about 300 feet away. Suddenly, about the time when we were about to eat we heard a loud howl. I call it a howl because I don't know how else to explain it. We both looked at each other and I said to her, \"What the hell was that?\" I'd say it was about 1 mile away, but I'm not sure. I do know that whatever made that sound was big. The sound we heard that night has the same characteristics as the \"howl\" recording on this website. The similarities are almost exact.",
