  "observed": "I was with my dad and a friend of his as well as his son who was a year younger than myself. We would go out just about every night to go Coon hunting. On One particular night we went to an area that had a large swamp and woods. There was a rough cut logging road running along the edge of the swamp. We had 3 coonhounds with us. We hadn't been there more than 30 minutes when the dogs started to sound off. At first they sounded normal and then they started yelping, like they were scared pups again. We all just stopped and listened. From the direction of the dogs, we could hear something breaking and snapping limbs and a deep bass growl. Then next thing we know the dogs, all 3 come running down the path past us with there tails between there legs, heading the way we came into the woods. My dad said boys lets get out of here. So we turned and ran out of the woods as well, with what ever it is still coming in our direction breaking limbs and sounding like smacking trees with another limb. When we got back to the truck the dogs where in there boxes on back of the truck, just shaking.  What was weird about all of this is these dogs we had with us at the time we have hunted bear and wildboar with them in Tennessee and they had no problem holding their own. So what ever it was they had never meet up with before and were scared.",
