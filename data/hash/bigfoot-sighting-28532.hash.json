  "observed": "Deer hunting, south 101 out of Aberdeen, mile post 69, turn left on m-line -- logging road, turn left onto m-2800 stay left, #4 were I found a 20ft tree upside down stuck into the ground, about three feet in-- root side up... took a picture and drove to end.  I parked and set up for some good hunting. Time 0845am. Sun out things a warming up. facing north with a lot of open clear cut area, glassing it all. The hill in front across the valley is 150 yards across, heavily treed. At 10:45 half way up the center of this hill, comes a loud crashing running straight down the hill in front of me. He makes a (my left- his right) turn and jumps on this deer killing it. The deer cries out three times and stops. All is now quiet again. I try making my way down my hill up the hill in front of me, nothing doing.. started to rain again, could not cross the river or creek, so I moved back to my spot to hunt.. nothing happening, so I went home at 1:30 pm.",
