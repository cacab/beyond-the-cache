  "observed": "The following interview was conducted by Stan Courtney. The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - Can you please explain what you saw? Mark - It was just before football and I was trying to get into shape so I went for a run. The sun was still up a little bit. I went running and stopped at the road and looked in front of me and saw this big tall thing standing in the road looking right back at me, I saw the outline of it, it was too far away to tell what it was. But I knew it was too big to be a person. Stan - How tall would you say it was? Mark - I would say close to nine feet. It was tall enough I could see its whole body. Stan - What was the animal doing when you first saw it? Mark - It wasn't doing anything, it was just standing there watching me. Stan - And what did you do? Mark - I turned around and went home. Stan - Were you able to tell what color it was? Mark - It was very dark brown. Stan - And how was it built? Mark - It was very muscular. Stan - Did it make any sounds? Mark - I didn't stick around long enough to hear anything. I don't think I told my dad about this, but the night I saw it while I was out running, I saw it looking through my front window. Stan - Of the house? Mark - Yes, and I was the only one at home, I was watching the Sci-Fi Channel. Its face was hairy but you could tell it had a human face to it. It was between a human face and an apes face I would have to say. When I looked out the window, I saw it. I didn't hear anything, I saw it once and took off and ran as fast as I ever have in my life. I turned on every light and ran up-stairs and got in the corner of my bedroom and I took the gun I had and pointed it at the door until my mom and dad got home.",
