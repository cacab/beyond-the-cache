  "observed": "On oct 16, 2008 me my best friend and girlfriend went up to our cabin in Cameron County pa, (montour run road) to start to scout for the upcoming bear season. on are way up to the cabin we checked other cabins on our road to see if anyone else was on the mountain that day. After and walk we went back to the cabin to eat. our cabin is very small made out of brick and is aprox. 15x10. we started to cook and on the side of the cabin opposite of the stove i heard a banging on the wall outside. i figured it may be a stick falling then it happened again in front of the stove (windows are closed didnt see anything). me and and my friend went out directly after to see if someone was there. there was no one. we went back in to eat and about 10min later there where three bangs on the door. we came out and walked around the cabin in opposite directions meeting on the back side. we didnt see or hear a thing but smelled an aweful odor. moments later an apple was thrown up the hill and landed about 20 ft in front of us. we got are stuff out the the cabin and went to the truck while loading the truck a stick was thrown. i am pretty sure that this was not a prank because we checked the other cabins on our way in and checked them on the way out. there were also no other vehicals on the mountain.",
