  "observed": "It was 6PM and I was supposed to meet my wife at FR 115 (**** mts away) at ****.  My son and I were just getting ready to leave the campsite.  As soon as I stood up from my chair, I saw what looked like a VERY large man in a ghillie suit walk across the opening in the trees to my left.  I had a clear sight and it was VERY large.  I could see the arms swaying, and my son was able to see the legs separate as it stepped.  It didn't seem to be in any rush, and seemed to be walking rather casually (kinda slow) but it covered a lot of ground in very few steps.  As I said, I could see both arms swaying, and it was not carrying a rifle or anything else that I could see.  Hunting season had been over for at least a week, and the next one wouldn't start up for months.  At this time, there was almost nobody out here, and nobody knew where we were.  I had my son stand where it had walked, and the top of his head would have been where it's shoulders where.  My son is 6 ft tall.  If it had been a man in a ghillie suit, the guy would have been at least 7 1/2 feet tall.",
