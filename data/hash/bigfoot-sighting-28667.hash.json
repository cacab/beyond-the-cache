  "observed": "Westfield , MA 3am Couldn't sleep and went outside to have a cigarette. Heard howls in the distance that I never heard before. I've worked as a wilderness counselor for the past 10 years and heard all sorts of animal noises in the night foxes, coyotes, owls etc.. This sound had a lack of clarity but power in its voice. I knew that it came from a long distance away. I remember listening to Bigfoot calls years back and on a hunch ran inside found the EXACT same howls on the net sounded like the Snohomish, WA 1978-79 calls. I woke up my friend who has been hunting western mass for 30 years and he said he never heard anything like it. He heard it and he said it gave him the chills. The howls trailed off as if he creature was moving. Incident lasted for about 10 minutes. I google mapped the area the sound came from and its a huge swath of wilderness that stretches into Vermont and south into Connecticut.",
