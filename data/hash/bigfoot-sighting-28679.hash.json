  "date": "2011-01-04",
  "observed": "I went for a hike at lunchtime in a newly made path that cuts through the Timber Ridge Forest Preserve. This path is surrounded by about 8 ponds. It has been very cold and snowy here in the teens and 20's for almost a month except for one warm day that melted the snow. All this melt caused the crushed gravel path to act like a white clay, making all the hikers/dogs/coyotes footprints visible in a 30 foot area. Along with these prints are bare footprints about 13 \" long. Looking at the 5 pictures I took, they're deeper set than all the other shoe prints, with 5 distinct toes. I've read BFRO reports before, but I didn't think this area of Illinois would ever have any kind of activity. I took a few pictures with my glove for scale. I measured the gait with my walking stick (3ft 10\") I'm 5' 9\" & tried to walk the gait of the prints but it was almost impossible. I followed them back to see where they started and they gradually came from the thick grass on the left. I just kept saying 'who would walk barefoot out here it's way too cold?'",
