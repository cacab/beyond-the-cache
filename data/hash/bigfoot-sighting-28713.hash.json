  "observed": "I was out hiking with my friend, north of Norris. It is a wooded area with lots of corn fields. As we were walking along this field when my friend called me over to look at what he had found in the mud. There were three giant footprints. They were deep, about four inches into the mud. The distance between each print was larger than I could walk. It looked like it had stepped out into the field and then turned back into the woods. My friend placed his boot next to the print and it was one and a half times larger than the foot. What impressed us the most other than the size was was that you could see all the toes.",
