  "observed": "After midnight, I heard more than a minute (possibly 2), a horrible, extremely loud screaming, unlike anything I've heard before or since. I was in a cabin getting ready for bed, but wide awake. The scream was very loud and seemed to be less than 30 meters from where I was. The sound was not a cat screaming, was not human, not bear. As I was hearing it, I ran through my mind the different animals, what it could possibly be. But it was a large animal, the volume was so loud. And a high-pitched screaming. I joke with people to whom I tell the story that it sounded like wildcats being fed through a meat grinder, but that only captures the high-pitched loudness and intensity, but it was NOT a cat. I didn't know what to think of it. I had heard of Bigfoot, but didn't know that they had been heard screaming. But 6 months later, I read an account that referred to this horrible screaming, and I knew that was what I had heard. I went to the store at Pinecrest the next day and asked the clerk if she had heard anything, and remember being astonished that she hadn't heard anything because it was so extremely loud.",
