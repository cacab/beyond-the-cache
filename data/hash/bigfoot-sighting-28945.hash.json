  "observed": "It was summer 2010, my girlfriend and I were saying our goodnights to each other and she left the loft in the garage. It was about midnight; she texted me about 5 minutes after she left about a banging noise. She thought it was me making those noises to scare her. And then a chill ran down my back, because the sound she was hearing was not from me. I told her it was not me and I was a little frightened at first and I did not hear the noise at all for the rest of the night. The next night around the same time, I was walking her home and her and I both heard the same noise. At first we did not mind until we heard it again, and it was closer. We rushed back inside and left the upstairs windows open to listen. We heard the banging noises multiple times, each time getting closer and closer. We kept on hearing leaves crackling like something was walking around and we could tell it was walking on two legs because it was a steady, slow walking pace. We shined the flashlight out the window but due to the trees, we could not see it. The noises continued until around 5am.",
