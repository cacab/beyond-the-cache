  "observed": "My Name is Margaret Whitney...1944.. I was 9 yrs. My brother was 8. We lived in N. Ca.  Just off the Klamath river, on McKinney Creek.  We were walking on a dirt road.. passing a clearing.  across the clearing about 50 yds, we saw three strange animals.  It was like looking at PaPa bear, MaMa bear and baby bear. From where we were..They seemed to have long necks.  There arms hung down almost to the ground. We stood and looked at them. They looked back at us. My brother and I kept asking each other \"what are they\"?  They turned and walked back into the woods.. we ran home to tell our Mother...She insisted that we saw sheep.  We know they were not sheep.  Later years..when Big Foot  was reported... I know that is what we saw.",
