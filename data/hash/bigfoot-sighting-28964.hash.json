  "observed": "I was traveling home from work in Gallup to Bluewater, South Side.  The time was about 8 p.m.  As I was traveling on hiway 612, right when I was exiting the sharp curves, I noticed a figure moving by the road on the right side.  I thought it was a very tall person at first but when I looked I noticed that it wasn't human.  As I got closer it started to cross the road and almost hit my truck.  It stopped and I did not want to stop because the road was ice packed and I didn't want to get stuck or run off the road.  I seen the creature a few feet thru my trucks passenger front window.  The creature's face looked ape and humanistic.  He was probably 7 feet tall because when he got real close to the vehicle I couldn't see his face.  He stood way over the truck. I was overwhelmed with fear at this point and just kept going home.",
