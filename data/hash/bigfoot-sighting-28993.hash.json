  "observed": "One evening my girl friend and I went for a ride to look for deer. We would take rides three or four times a week mostly riding the back roads. One evening as we were driving down a road (Rader Road towards County BB) I noticed someone walking in the ditch on the right side of the road. At the time I kept my eyes on him because I thought he was walking on the roadway, as I drove nearer I noticed that he was walking in the ditch. About this time my girl friend ask me what that was walking on the roadway, I told her that it was not walking on the roadway but in the ditch which was about 5 feet below the roadway. I knew the depth because my brother and I went smelting there a few times. I explained to her that what ever was walking there had to be about 8’ or 9’ feet tall. She wanted to turn around and drive by it again to get a closer look I told her no that we would go around the back way which would take about 30 minutes, I wanted it to be gone when we came back.",
