  "observed": "I live in Defiance, Ohio along the Auglaize River. I was going upriver in my rowboat (with a motor) while the river was flooded. I like to go out to see if I can spot deer. I got a mile or so upriver and was rounding a bend in the river where there are lots of trees piled up from floods. I saw a glimpse of what looked like a small Bigfoot, three or four feet in height. It walked up a log and disappeared over the pile of trees, just then I looked to my right and saw three deer standing there looking at me. I jokingly said to the deer, did you see that? Just when I started to speak I heard a scream that would curdle milk. I just sat there fighting the current watching the deer. They started looking around trying to see what made the noise. For the heck of it I started talking to see if it would happen again. It did, only louder and longer than before. The deer took off and I did to.  I have lived on the river my whole life and have never heard that before. Since then I have spotted what seems to be the same creature watching me while I was sitting in a lagoon off the river. It's a good spot to see wildlife. The creature I've seen is small, only three to four feet tall, and is always in the shadows where I can't get a good look at it.",
