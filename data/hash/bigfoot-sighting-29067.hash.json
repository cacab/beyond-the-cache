  "observed": "On the night of March 30-actually the 31, since it was 2 AM, I heard a horrible call that I have only heard before on TV shows where the researchers play the  cries of Bigfoot in the  hopes of attracting one. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Shortly after this long call, I heard  another strange cry that was higher-pitched. I have NEVER heard this anywhere but on TV.",
