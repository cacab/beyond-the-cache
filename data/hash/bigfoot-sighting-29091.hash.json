  "observed": "I am from northern lower Michigan and two years ago was driving on I-75 just north of Wolverine, Michigan.  It was in the middle of summer and I was driving alone to see my family on Mullet Lake. In the distance I could see brake lights and was curious as to why so many cars were stopping because there is NEVER any traffic in that area.  So I stopped behind a few cars but it was visible as to what everyone was stopped for.  Ahead to my right a massive figure was stepping out of the woods and at first I thought it was a huge bear but it was walking on its hind legs.  It was covered in dark hair and was taller then any bear i have ever seen.  So then I thought it was a gorilla, because its hands were curled under as if it had been walking on them previously.  The creature crossed the highway and then proceeded into the woods on the left of me.  I thought i was dreaming, so i looked over to the car on my right and their faces were just as shocked as mine were.  I made it up to our cottage and told my family but everyone just laughed and to this day when I tell the story of how I have seen big foot nobody believes me.  But there is absolutely no way this was a bear or gorilla.   In northern michigan a bear is possible but it was walking like a human.",
