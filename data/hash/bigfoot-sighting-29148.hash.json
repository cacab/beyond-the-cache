  "title": "Backpackers startle a figure with long white/blonde hair watching Boy Scouts at Grandaddy Lake",
  "date": "2009-07-11",
  "observed": "I was backpacking with my brother and four nephews at Granddaddy Lake.  We were setting up camp, and my brother and I went off to find a tree to hang our food on.  We were getting closer to a group of boy scouts we had been hearing while setting up camp.  My brother was looking into the trees and I glanced over towards where the scouts were, when I saw something with long white/blond hair was staring into their camp.  It must have been startled by our presence because it took off running extremely fast toward the marsh area.  I remember very vividly the hair bouncing as it took long strides.  The lack of noise that it made along with the speed startled me to the point that I unbuckled my gun holster, concerned for our safety.  My brother didn't see what I did because he was too concerned with why I was going for my gun.   From the way it was running I could tell it was on two legs, although I couldn't see below the shoulders due to the vegetation in the area.  I would estimate the height about 6ft.  The odd thing for me is that I didn't go over to the location to look for prints, although it was standing in a very wet area.  It was bothering me badly to the point that we went over to the scoutâ€™s camp and asked if anyone in their party had blond or white hair.  None of the scouts had blond or white hair.  Everyone in my party told me I was crazy, but later I found out it was because they were scared and didn't want to think about it.",
