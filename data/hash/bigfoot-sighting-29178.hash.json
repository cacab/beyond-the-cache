  "observed": "As a passenger in my brother-in-law's car I was returning to my rental house in Clark Lake from Adrian on a Sunday evening. I was a nineteen year old college sophomore attending Jackson Community College and my bother-in-law was driving me back to school after a weekend at my parent's home in Adrian. Suddenly, while driving west on M-50 near the Jackson County border, a large bipedal, reddish-brown/auburn(brother-in-law's description) colored creature crossed the highway from passenger-to-driver side in front of us. The event happened so fast that for a few awkward seconds I was totally absorbed in stunned silence. This was shortly broken when my brother-in-law asked my brother and I if we had seen that which had just crossed the road in front of us. I acknowledged that I had. I seriously doubt whether I would have shared my experience with the others' if my brother-in-law had not acknowleged it first. The creature was defintely large, bipedal, hairy, and crossed in front of us approximately 75-100 feet in at an incredible rate of speed and corresponding grace. No head was discernible and it did not look back at us as it passed.",
