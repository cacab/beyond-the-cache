  "observed": "In 1996 in late November on a Sat. about 12:30 a.m. my daughter and I were driving back to my home at Laconia, Indiana. Instead of driving down SR 111 we decided to take Corydon Pike up the hill to Edwardsville and then on to Elizabeth, Indiana. I have never been afraid to drive up Edwardsville Hill and still not. On this night the moon was out and through the trees you could see some moonlight. We were driving along talking and crossed the railroad tracks going up the hill. The road is very winding, with dips and curves. On the second curve it dips down and comes back up so your car lights are hitting an old driveway up to someones home on top of the hill. Just as we started to come out of the dip, our car lights showed a large hairy figure sitting on an old felled tree at the foot of this driveway. My daughter screamed and said give the car some gas. I did so, but I wanted to go back and see what it was sitting there. My daughter said, \"No Mom , whatever it is leave it alone\". I have lived here most of my life and have been afraid to tell anyone of what we saw. My son said, \" there is no such thing as a Bigfoot\" but I believe there is. I have always been told there are things in the world unexplained. This is one of them. Just another one of God's creatures.",
