  "observed": "It was right around the time of my birthday.  I was on vacation visiting with my cousin at his girlfriend's house.  We had ran into Jerseyville for cigarettes and were on our way back to her house off of Otterville Blacktop.  I was driving about 55 mph around the s-curves just before Shiloh Hollow Road when I caught something running across the field heading for the road in the headlights. At first I thought it was a man in a trench coat.  It ran up the embankment and onto the road in front of the car.  I barely missed it.  It just made it in front of the car as I passed and half turned towards me at the center line of the road.  Within four foot from my side of the car. I realized that it wasn't a man in a trench coat.  It was covered in hair and his face look flattened with a wide nose and large nostrils, and huge eyes.  I continued to watch this thing run up a twenty foot embankment on the other side of the road without ever losing its pace.  In shock I turned to look at my cousin, his eyes were as big as mine and we found ourselves asking, \"What the hell was that\"?  He agreed It wasn't human.",
