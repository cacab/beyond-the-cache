  "observed": "It was the summer of 1977 and I was 18. My father and I were traveling across country as a graduation present. We camped off old logging roads and the like.  We were camped on July 10, 1977 off an old road near Quakertown Pennsylvania. After we got our campsite set up I went for a walk to have a cigarette (I went alone because my dad didn't know I smoked, or so I thought).  It was about 3pm and a bright sunny day. I was near a dried up river bed when I saw something move out of the corner of my eye. When I looked to my right across the other side of the river or creek bed I saw a large beigy or light brown hair covered man-like animal. It was crouching or sitting, I couldn't tell. It made no eye contact, but I knew it was moving out of sight because of me.  It just slowly ambled into the bushes and out of view. I was scared to death. I ran back to where my dad was and he followed me back to the site where I saw \"it\".  He noted a deep depression in the land where it had been crouching or laying and he said the hair on the back of his neck raised up. But there was no further sign of the animal.",
