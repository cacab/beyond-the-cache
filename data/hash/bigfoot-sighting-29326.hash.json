  "observed": "We were walking back from a nightly walk killing time waiting for people to arrive at my friend [name removed]'s house when we got about 300 ft. from his house we heard a noise behind us just at the tree line at the edge of the road, [name removed] turned his head back to look ,next thing I know he's running yelling run man run, I stopped and turned to see a figure on the top of the embankment stepping down across the ditch to the middle of the dirt road, I stood their for only about 5 seconds but it was enough to confirm my belief that sasquatch lives, it made a quick grunt like sound ,thats when I began to run. At that time all 5 of [name removed]'s chow dogs ran past me to go after whatever was their,I heard what sounded like the most awful dog fight ever in the woods along with what sound like a just a heavy roar and some shrieks along with some dog wimpering. After about 15 seconds of this the dogs returned .",
