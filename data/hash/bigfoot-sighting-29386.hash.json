  "observed": "I was in the woods one morning when I heard a very distinct noise - or noises. It started out with a rustling of leaves that sounded more like something had found a small tree and was just shaking it - that went on for a few seconds. Then we heard a long, low howl followed by growls, grunts, snorts, and higher-pitched squeals. The sequence of noises then repeated itself, starting with the rustling. It was very loud. I've hunted those woods since I could walk, I know every sound that every animal makes, in every season, and for every situation. I know when the birds are talking about me and when an animal knows I'm around. Whatever I heard that day...it was not any animal I've heard before.",
