  "date": "2009-07-11",
  "observed": "My friend and I were sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette and talking about the recent drama going on in our lives. Straight in front of us about 60 yards was an iron ore hill, the top of it was clearly visible with a straight flat top as most of them are. On the top of the hill in the middle of our view was a single tree. As we were talking and smoking a person comes walking on the top of the hill. I started to make fun of the way this person was walking. The Arms were long and swaded back and forth with each stride. The legs were also long and odd looking as it walked. It walked in a frumpy way. the upper back was hunched slightly. It passed the tree and thats when I said, \"look how tall that person is.\" It was about 4 feet taller than the tree. In the time that it took to walk in and out of our view point was about 40 seconds. After it was out of sight was then when we realized that no person could walk that distance in that short of time, and no person would be that tall looking that far away. I seriously feel that we saw bigfoot that day.",
