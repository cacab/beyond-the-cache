  "observed": "I was staying in my trailer on my friends property, their house was just slightly uphill from where my trailer was parked.They only came up on weekends, because of this i was there alone most of the time.They had a motion sensor light on there porch that would turn on whenever anything would get close to the house. Numerous times it would turn on so after a while i started sneaking uphill to see what was triggering it. Being in the forest there I got to see all kinds of animals (elk,deer,fox,coyotes,etc.) without them seeing or smelling me because of the way the hill was I could peer over the crest unnoticed. One night the light went on, I was like cool lets see what animal is there this time. When i got to the top of the hill and peered over there was a giant human like silouette standing about 50 feet from me 20 feet from the house it howled/screamed/growled like nothing i ever heard before i turned and ran as fast as i could. I was terrified! What convinced me it was bigfoot was the size shape and sound later that week on tv an Oregon audio recording of supposed bigfoot was the sound i heard exactly. Im 100% convinced it was bigfoot.The following day i did look for prints but it was june and bone dry during fire season so i found nothing.",
