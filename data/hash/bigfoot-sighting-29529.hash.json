  "observed": "I'm a fishing guide in Florida for over 25 years and spend apx 200 days on the water a year. On a charter last month I had a Delta pilot and lawyer on my boat. As we poled into a remote area of the Merrit island National Wildlife Refuge,I noticed something bent over and walking up a sand bank,apx 100 yards from us. It was just after good daylight. I thought bear?,hog? as it walked closer,one of my clients noticed it and said,\"what the f(*& is that?\" I was speechless,it walked to within 40 yards,stood up and faced us for about 15 sec. It took 3 steps,turned sideways and looked at us over it's shoulder for another 10 sec,then walked into the mangroves. The pilot said that was a F(*& sasquatch! It was apx. 6/7 ft tall,long reddish brown hair, and was built like a side by side fridge,very square. It's face looked more cave man then ape. The wind was in our face and we were silent in my flats skiff,I think that is why he did'nt know we were there as he was hunting the sand beach for food.",
