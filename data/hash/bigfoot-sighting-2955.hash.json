  "observed": "R.L.  and some friends were shooting bottle rockets off over the gravel area and river around midnight on the Fourth of July, 1997.  A car stereo was on with the bass turned up.  It was about 30  to 45 minutes after starting to shoot the bottle rockets that R. heard the first \"whoop\".  He was walking on a log when he heard \"WHOOP, WHOOP, WHOOP\".  Each whoop was rising in tone and also rising in tone from the last one. \"The hair stood up on my neck\" R. said There was was about 10 to 20 of these \"WHOOP, WHOOP, WHOOP\"s.  It sounded like they were about a mile away, but seemed to be getting closer, or louder, as they progressed. The forest was extremely quiet except for the \"Whoops\".  Everyone was scared and wanted to leave the area immediately, which is what they did.",
