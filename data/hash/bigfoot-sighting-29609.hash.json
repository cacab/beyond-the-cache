  "observed": "I have been having encounters with what I believe is a family group for almost 2 years now. Prints, wood knocks, smells, dog panic, sightings,  and verbal interactions. Our house was lifted. The newest is snow angel marks in grass and clearings and with trails blocked by x formations made with trees. Visit 2 or 3 times weekly. Less in winter, I'm not out as much, keeping it quiet. No other people notice. I'm on 2.5 acres. Lake in back yard center of long beach peninsula, rural. Square mile of forest 300 yards away. Clams on beach, oysters in bay",
