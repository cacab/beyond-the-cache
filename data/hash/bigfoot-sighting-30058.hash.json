  "observed": "My family has a lot of private property in upper Cherokee Park by red feather lakes. A lot of deer and moose and elk.We went up for a elk hunt night, fall had just swept over camp. We got a fire going and had no other light. We could see about 40 foot or so, it was about 1 min after the fire got going we heard boom boom boom on the hollow ground. Out of no where there it was, about 40 foot away there was a white upright monster. It stopped, hunched down and turned to make a chilling stare at us for a sec. but it felt like time had stopped for me. I blinked and it stood up and was 10 foot or better. Seemed like it took about 7 to 9 steps and it was gone. All this took a little over 40 sec., felt like a hour.",
