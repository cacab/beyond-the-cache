  "date": "2003-09-13",
  "observed": "In 2003 I was driving on Widewater Road in Stafford VA, just South of Quantico Marine Corp Base. I was going west from the Potomac River area. It was just after dusk and my 13 year old daughter and I were traveling at about 40 MPH. I came around a bend through a wooded area when my headlights caught an animal that was hairy, walked upright and stood about 8 feet or so tall. The animal paused in the middle of the road and as we slowed down the animal turned its head to look in our direction, after a few seconds the animal turned and continued walking south into the woods. Neither my daughter nor I could specifically identify exactly what we saw but we know we did not see a bear.",
