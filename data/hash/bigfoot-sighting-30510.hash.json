  "date": "2011-08-14",
  "observed": "On August 14, 2011, I was walking through heavily wooded area and decided to walk along creek bed. I came upon what looked like a very large footprint. I could clearly see the entire outline of the foot, as well as 5 distinct toe prints. I did not have measuring tape but l took pictures and measured with pack of gum and a cigarette pack. If I have to guess the length and width I would say at least 17 inches long and at least 7 inches wide. Had seen couple other prints on hillside but could not capture image well on my camera. Shortly after I finished studying print and wondering what made it, I continued walking creek bottom. I heard movement and large branch being twisted. At that time I decided to get out of the woods. I go back often because I know that the group of Sasquatches are not gonna hurt me. They are trying to get my attention and are testing me.",
