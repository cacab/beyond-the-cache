  "observed": "At about 10:45 PM EDT I walked out to my work vehicle to grab a smoke and my phone. After I shut the door I heard something hit the building next door followed by \"whooping\". \"WHOOOOWHOOP\" A lower tone followed by a higher one. VERY SIMILAR to your recordings.... almost spot on. This continued for about a minute or two. Not the first time I've heard it either. I came across your site while looking for sounds similar to that then found your clips.",
