  "observed": "I was using the outhouse right after I had woken up at about 9 in the morning.  I was in the outhouse when I heard a rustling of leaves and sticks breaking.  This wasn't unusual as we have a lot of deer near our house.  The noise kept getting closer and closer,  at this point I figured that it wasn't a deer because it was coming so close to the out house.  I hastly pulled my pants up and opened the door.  I saw bigfoot.  He was very much like other people had described him tall, hairy, and buff.  He looked like an over-sized monkey.  As soon as he saw me he took off into the woods.  Later that night my whole family heard screams, we assumed it was bigfoot eating a deer but we weren't sure.",
