  "observed": "In 1987, I was 16.  My parents & I lived in a log house (3 stories) in Waleska, on top of a mountain.  My room was in the basement (it was like my own little apartment!). I kept my window open during summer, to catch the cool breeze at night.  One night, I was trying to go to sleep and heard in the distance a loud howling/moaning/screaming sound.  Really hard to describe.  You would expect bears, bobcats and your occasional wart hog around those parts of the woods, but I had never heard this sound before.  It made me literally sick to my stomach.  I laid there in silence, with my Great Dane, who was also startled by the sound.  About 5 minutes later, I heard heavy steps outside my window.  I then smelt something horrific and heard footsteps on the deck. I felt that whatever it was was looking through my window at that point.  My dog was pretty much under the covers, hiding, with me.  Whatever it was seemed to pace back and forth in front of my window for about 2 or 3 minutes and then it paced off. Later, I heard that same wrenching howl/moan/scream thingy.  At that point, I scurried and closed my window.  Needless to say, I had trouble sleeping and did not ever sleep with my window open!  I have continuously had nightmares about Big Foot even to this day!  It is good to read other stories such as mine.",
