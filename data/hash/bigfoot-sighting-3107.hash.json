  "title": "Long range sighting of a tall, fast-moving animal traversing a snow field below Table Mountain (Mt. Baker area)",
  "date": "2001-09-09",
  "observed": "On Sunday, September 9, 200l my husband, Joseph and I were picnicing at Mt. Baker in the area of Heather Meadows. About 2pm we observed a large black figure that appeared to stand erect traversing a snow field below Table Mountain. We were about a thousand feet below and were amazed at the speed the object moved. At first we thought we were watching a person but realized a human could not move at that speed up an ice field. We were mesmerized by the speed and the steepness of the terrain. At that point we knew it was not human. We found a park ranger and he suggested it might have been a bear. However, this thing stood erect the whole time, maybe 10 minutes. Joe and I kidded that we saw Big Foot but the more we think about it the more we don't think it was a bear. Too bad we didn't have our binoculars. I am a teacher in Bellingham and my husband is an accountant. Hopefully, somebody else saw this. Please let us know. Roxanne",
