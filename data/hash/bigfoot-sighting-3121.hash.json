  "date": "2001-09-06",
  "observed": "I was camping in the backcountry of Sequoia National Park. Just after sunset, I heard numerous repeated screams. They were not human and I have never heard an animal that made that sound. I have been camping and backpacking in those woods for 20 years and I have never heard anything like that. It sounded almost identical to some supposed bigfoot screams that have been recorded over the years. It sounded like a combination of a man yelling, a woman screaming and a dinosaur roaring all wrapped into one sound. It went on for maybe 30 seconds and abruptly ended. It was a very unnerving noise.",
