  "date": "2009-11-28",
  "observed": "In 2009 during the riffle buck (deer) season I was hunting in Slaughters Creek, Kanawha County, West Virginia out on a mining/logging rd when I saw what I thought to be a bear until I got about 80 yrds from the creature it was upright around 7 1/2 ft tall & looked like a linebacker, huge there was a stench in the air like a combination of wet dog & body odor as I walked up the road. I must have stepped on a twig or it caught my scent it turned sharply made a grunt noise then in about 3 steps was up a hillside that would have taken myself 20-25 steps to go up. It went over the ridge and disappeared into the woods. My eyes were watering from fear, my body was shaking I had a 30-06 rifle on me yet I didn't feel like I could have shot. I think I scared it as much as it scared me.",
