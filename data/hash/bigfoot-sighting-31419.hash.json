  "title": "Possible nighttime sighting and vocalizations in a backyard near Old Ripley",

  "observed": "I was in bed and heard my dogs barking outside. I went out in time to see the dog run under the porch and something duck into the woods. I first thought it to be a large man in a coat but upon shouting and throwing a small stone into the trees discovered otherwise. Responding to my shout it shrieked/howled and tossed the stone back at me. It landed at my feet and then silence took hold in the trees again. I ran inside in a panic and finding a flashlight headed out to search for the intruder. I found only torn twisted horseweed and snapped branches about five and a half feet up. I have not seen it since but it stood easily six feet stooped,  smelled like a rotting carcass even in the winter and walked on two then four legs. I have however seen trails in the woods before and after the incident that looked as if they were made by a very similar animal.",
