  "observed": "It was late July 2007 and my wife and I had brought our newborn baby daughter home just a few days earlier. It was about 1 AM and I was in the living room of my house watching television after pulling 2nd shift at work. My wife and baby daughter were two rooms away sleeping. She had opened the bedroom window earlier to let a little cool air in. All of a sudden a scream came from that corner of the house that stood me right up off the couch. I ran to the bedroom to find my wife sitting up in the bed as wide eyed and shocked as me. When I finally gathered myself enough and went outside to investigate, I found nothing. We kind of forgot about it until watching Finding Bigfoot several years later. They played what they thought were howls of the creature recorded on tape. My wife and I looked at each other and totally agree that whatever made the howls on the program is exactly what we heard that night. It's a sound you never forget.",
