  "observed": "My son and I were out fishing one night in July of 2011 at about 1am on friday night at the Matanza bridge back waters, this is on A1A in Florida. at about 2:00 am, we heard this really weird sound of howling and grunts so we sat there for about 25 minutes or so and the sound kept getting louder and closer to where we were parked. My son said to me dad did you see that, I said what and he said something really big was approaching where we were parked sitting in the car. So he winded up the window and said we better leave, so i said no just wait a little bit longer and lets see if it will come back. after about another 10 minutes or so the howling began again but this time it seemed to be more than one howl, as if there was a reply to the deeper howl. So I told him to start the car and lets get out of the area. Well he did so and we were leaving the area and after we traveled about 100 yards or so there it was one of the biggest Bigfoots right in front of us. It was about 9 feet tall really hairy and walking with a slight crouched posture, It was headed East to the ocean. I saw it briefly as we passed to where it crossed the road but it was moving really fast, not running just really long strides. It looked back briefly and went under the bridge and out to the ocean.",
