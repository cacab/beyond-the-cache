  "observed": "On the evening of January 4, 2012, my fiance, her grandmother, and I were driving back to Broken Bow from my fiance's baby appointment in Talihina, Ok. I had just awakened from a nap-i was riding in the back seat-and I looked out the window to see about where we were. I had noticed that there was a power line trail on a hill that was near the hwy we were driving on. Next to a power line pole was the silhouette of something large. I say silhouette because the sun was on it's way to setting, causing the side that was facing me of whatever was standing there to be shadowed. Within a second of me spotting it, it ducked to it's left into the wood line. This was not a bear-the shoulders were clearly defined and it looked to large to be a person.  Now a short background of myself, I am prior military, have never done drugs, and have been around woods all my life. My attention to detail is immaculate and I know when something is out of place. I know what I saw and will stand by my story. Also as an avid bigfoot follower/believer I have a habit of checking power line trails when passing by. To me, there is no other explanation-i have no doubt that was sasquatch.",
