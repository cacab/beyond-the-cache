It was all strip mine areas run by the Peabody coal Company. Myself, cousin and 2 friends were hiking on the hills. We were standing on top of a tall hill that we Called Highest peak. We heard a cow bellowing about 150 yards away. I was the highest on the hill. Out from behind a small hill into a clearing out walks a large White Creature that was very tall and very large. It walked on 2 legs. When I saw it, I screamed to my cousin and friends. As soon as I screamed It immediately stopped Turned towards me and stared at me. We had direct eye to eye contact for probably several seconds. It then turned back and walk the direction that it was coming from. As young boys we were petrified and ran back to the areas where we were camping. We told the adults but no one paid attention that we'd seen a monster. It was only then about a month later one of the parents gave as an article describing exactly what we saw but located to the South in Murphysboro Illinois. I have never seen anything similar to it or heard anything about it. I was given your organization's name by Stan Courtney. I am now 50 years old, a medical neurologist. But this event has been etched to my mind Like it was yesterday.",
