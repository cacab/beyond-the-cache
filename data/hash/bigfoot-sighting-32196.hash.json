  "observed": "I live in Granite City. Just across the river from St. Louis Missouri. Where we lived we used to see bigfoot on a regular basis. Had encountered many sitings from them standing at our picture window of the house to being in the barn with our horses have not seen any in a long time due to expansion in the area and habitat destruction. Have found scat and they are omnivores from the shape it looks human not vegetarian. May be a good area to search some time in the future in area locations, still a lot of wooded areas locally.",
