  "observed": "I spotted a human/animal like creature with a large stocky build covered with shaggy black hair bound across a two lane highway at about 12:40 AM on October 20, 2001.  The creature was crossing the road in the front of a vehicle that I was operating, it leaped from about the center line of the road to the bank which was on the right hand side I estimate the distance of this leap to be about 15 or more feet , a passenger was riding with me and had also seen this occur. It was obvious to me that this creature was making every effort to get out of sight into the cover of brush  and the darkness as fast as it could without injuring itself. The creature never went to a four legged position before it leaped or after it landed the creature remained on two legs for the brief period that it was visible.",
