  "observed": "It was around 4:30 p.m. we were heading back to Lake Tomahawk from Woodruff.  It was sunny but sun was low in the sky,  Forest on each side of the highway, leaves were down with thick undergrowth and thick with pine trees. We saw an all black figure run across the road. It was about 7-8 feet tall and lanky. It took about 5 strides to cross from forest to forest. It ran straight up-- stride effortlessly without stumbling or looking side to side just looked straight ahead. It ran across the road in 3-4 seconds. the sides of the road were at a 40 degree angle to the road bed. It was about 3 football fields in front of us. There was a small red car about 200ft in front of us but it showed no reaction. It did not slow down. We pinpointed where it went in and out the woods and there was no trails or road. You could not tell any features but the head appeared cone shape and long.",
