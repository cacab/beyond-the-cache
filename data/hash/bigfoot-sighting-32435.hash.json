  "observed": "Around 1978 or so, my mom, dad, brother and little sister and i lived in oglethorpe georgia which is macon county.We lived on hwy 49. We had a hand full of run ins with the sasquatch and his offspring.The first time we saw it was when it came up to my infant sisters window and she was mocking it,I think it got confused one night and went to my moms window and started grunting and scared my mom so bad she tried to climb up under my dad,he told her he thought it was probably a bear(that is until he saw it for himself)my mother went out to get the note off of the door and it was about ten feet at most away from her,she ran back inside and when she was able to speak she told my dad what she saw,my dad went into the bathroom and shot the larger one,One night we had acetylene tanks being thrown around by the larger one ,she said he was black,hair from head to toe,arms were past the waist line,nose was not like a gorillas,was more like human nose.We heard a noise outside one night and went out to look and found hair embedded into the wall of the outside of the house.It always came to the house at night,It was very curious,always looking into the windows,my aunt heard something one night and ran so fast that she actually put an indention into the wall of the house.My dad said one night all of my uncles came over and they were looking around the house for it and one of my uncles yelled down from the roof of the house that my dad was leaning against it,and when he turned around and looked up at it,it got spooked and beat the hood of the jeep and destroyed it.In our area where we lived there was always goats and cows etc..found with their intestines gone,no meat was eaten.It did always smell like a septic tank when it came around.We went outside the next day after an incident with it we went outside and our neighbor who owned cows had five cows laying on their sides,dead with their insides gone,next to the cow field where the pond was.Then when i was about fourteen years old we moved back to almost the exact spot we lived in when we had experienced it the first hand full of times,we cleared the woods across from where we lived before so we could put the trailer on the property,I was sleeping one night and thought my alarm went off,i checked it and apparently it was some other noise that woke me up,i looked out the window and saw an eight foot tall hairy creature running from my window,my dad went outside right away and did a cast of the foot print.We had a friend who was a game warden when we lived in west palm florida who went out and and was recording what she thought was a bear,she was in her vehicle out in the middle of the woods,on the recording we heard a howl like sound that was unlike anything we have ever heard,it sent chills up our spine,and then it started shaking her vehicle side to side,then it ran off.",
