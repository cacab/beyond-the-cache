  "observed": "I was driving home at night from one of my meetings for work, and I was on a backroad since I live in the country and it was nighttime. I heard a loud thump on my truck door and thought someone had threw something at me or that I had hit something. When I got out of the truck and walked to the other side their was scratches all down my passenger truck door. I got extremely scared so I had my dad and brother come get me, and that is when we then found footprints all along the middle of the dirt road and it went on it seems like miles. As we were taking pictures of the footsteps, we heard something. My dad shined the flashlight into the field we saw greenish looking eyes above the brust and a little off to the distance. My brother ran with the flashlight towards it, it stood there as he got closer it just disappeard and we started hearing loud knocks and a really weird growl so my dad yelled and made my brother come back. It was the scarest moment I have every had",
