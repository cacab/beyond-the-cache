  "date": "2011-11-24",
  "observed": "It was Thursday 11/25/11 at approximatly 8:20 just outside of Albion Oklahoma. I have 50-acres of mountain hunting land on K-trail mountain road. It was lightly raining and around 50 deg. I was by myself setting up a second feeder for the morning hunt. I walked approximatly 30 yards off the road to move some brush and I heard a very strange howl/growl. It was just on the other side of the road by my truck. I started heading back to my truck and it howled again. I had never heard anything like this before. I yelled back at it, and it responded with a more aggressive howl. Shortly after that a large rock came up through the brush and landed in the road. This exchange of howls/growls went on for 20-minutes. I never saw anything but I can tell you it wasn't a bear or deer. I guess there is something to the sign I saw on Indian highway \" Indian HWY Home of Bigfoot\".",
