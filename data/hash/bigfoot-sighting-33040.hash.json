  "date": "2010-11-18",
  "observed": "I was out deer hunting down in a valley on my Dad's property and right as the sun was beginning to break I heard a loud scream. I looked over in the direction of that scream and saw something black as far as I could see and then it just disappeared. I don't know if this has anything to do with it either but our deer population has dramatically decreased over the years.",
