  "observed": "I was outside of the home where my 1st wife was raised at Dodge Point where her father owned some land. I was walking thru a patch of trees when I heard a loud stomping. At first I thought it may be horses running but realized that there were only two feet making the sound and not four. I was looking around to see what else might happen when on the edge of one of the surrounding fields stood a line of fairly tall trees. I heard a loud noise coming from the trees and I looked and saw the first two trees being violently shaken. I kept looking and between the second and third tree I saw the left arm and shoulder of a Sasquatch. The stomping sound quickly subsided. I ran back to the house and got my wife and we drove into town and told her parents what had happened. There have been several sightings in the past at Dodge Point.",
