  "observed": "We lived on Little Pine Road, Emily, MN for twelve years and frequently heard odd animal sounds coming out of the woods.  There was/is uninhabited wilderness for 20 miles North and 15 miles to the South. Moments after I crawled into bed, my wife whispered to me, \"Jim!  There is something outside the window!\"  so I quietly got up and when I flipped the light switch to on, I saw three sets of eyes (each set of eyes was 5 to 8\" apart) that were somewhat orange around the periphery and vague outlines of heads were pressed against the window screen.  One of the critters appeared to be stooping to see into the top of the window, 6' above the ground.  After a blood curdling bi-syllabic scream, the bi-pedal critters ran off.",
