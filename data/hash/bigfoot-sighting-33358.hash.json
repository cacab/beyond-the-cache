  "observed": "One day some friends and myself were out for a drive in Carteret County,NC in the early afternoon, we were on this two-track road called FR-144 outside Havelock,NC when we came around this bend in the road we all saw something very strange, a very large, dark figure walking on two legs toward us about 75 yards away, it was only for a few seconds because whatever this was turned and walked straight into the woods. When we got to the spot we all agreed we thought it went into the woods we stopped but did not see anything. The ground was dry and hard so we did not see any signs of it. I don't think it was human because it was an area that has no farms, homes or anything on it and it is just wilderness, also it was dark from head to toe and it appeared to us that it did not want us to see it.",
