  "title": "Late night sighting by teen at Lost Creek Golf Course",
  "date": "1987-03-15",
  "observed": "I was walking home from my friends house around 1:00 am. We had been playing video games at his house. I was 15 at the time. I wasn't scared of walking across the golf course, I did it several times. There is a creek that runs through the course. As I was walking across the bridge of the creek, I heard a noise. When I looked down to the creek, I saw what appeared to be a LARGE bear looking thing bending over drinking water. It looked at me and his face appeared to be human! This thing was big!! dark hair covered the body but with a human face. I only glanced at the thing for a couple seconds, then ran as fast as I could home. It scared the &*&*&* out of me! It didn't follow me, but I didn't look back to see. I just ran. I didn't tell anybody, just a couple of my close friends, and I never walked across the golf course at night again.",
