  "observed": "It was February 25th 12:50am up at our family cabin which is located between the Ottawa National and Nicolet National Forest.  The Cabin is on a deadend street, a few roads off of an entrance to a lake.  I had woken up to go to to the bathroom an had to go really bad but the bathroom was being used so I went outside the cabin to go to the bathroom outside.  When I stepped outside I could hear a few dogs down one of the main streets barking frantically.  I took a few steps outside from our side door to go to the bathroom.  I heard a very loud knock (50-100yds) to my left (NW) towards the dead end side of the road.",
