  "title": "Daylight sighting along a highway near Big Cedar",
  "date": "2012-03-18",
  "observed": "My wife and I were in Broken Bow, OK on Sun. the 18th of March 2012. We live in Arkansas about 20 miles west, but on a whim decided to take a 2 hr detour north on HWY 259 and cut across Rich Mt. Rich Mt is the highest point in the Ouachita Mts. I had commented about how squatchy the area looked and my wife replied that we would not see one in the day time. Well, about 45 minutes later she saw one. We were about a mile south of Talimena Scenic By-Way on 259, right on the west end of Rich Mt. She said it was about 35-40 ft off the road walking behind a tree. She described it as being 9-10 ft tall with stringy hair of varying shades of brown. She noticed it was bipedal with long arms swinging in the usual 'squatchy' way. She was very firm when I asked if perhaps it was a bear and said that she knew what she saw. As my luck goes, we were at a point where the road was hairpin curves with no shoulders and no way to turn around. I guess I'll have to wait for my first sighting. One thing she mentioned was noticing the muscles in the arms and legs. If this was a man in a suit they went to some trouble to pull it off.",
