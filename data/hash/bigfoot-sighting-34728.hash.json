  "date": "1996-10-12",
  "observed": "Basically, it was the area of the Sangamon river bottoms between the old Rt 36 bridge and the Rt 54 bridge in Riverton. It must have been at least 15 years ago. I was riding my minibike through the trails in the area. I lost control of the bike in a sand pit, amongst some deep shrubbery. As I looked up to get my bearings, I saw a large hominoid creature standing next to a tree about 25 yards ahead of me. I was slightly disoriented from the crash, but what I saw was a large male looking individual, more than 7 feet tall, very heavy built, with thin redish hair covering its body. It looked at me for just a moment and walked into the thick brush. That was basically it. I remember it very clearly.",
