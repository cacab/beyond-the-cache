  "observed": "I was with my son, a friend and his son and a friend of his son's at his families camp in Adams county Ohio. The kids all day said they were seeing something with yellow eyes, but my friend Steve and I never saw it. It was in the summer time and his camp butts up to a nature preserve, and my friend Steve and his son hunt deer here every year. That night my son and I slept in our tent and Steve and the 2 boys were in his van. I got up in the early morning hours and opened the tent flap and stepped out in front and relieved myself. As I was doing this, just right in front of me about 10 to 15 feet I hear a series of grunts. I freaked and finished and got back in the tent and listened in fear. As I was laying there I could here something walking closer and go near the car. I heard the car being bumped and a grunt and the tent was brushed and another grunt and sniff, then walking away. I really didn't think about it being a Bigfoot until I saw your show about Ohio and that region. I would love to invite you guys to the site and camp there and branch out in the woods and look for him or her. Steve and I may go back soon once the weather gets warmer. Not asking to be on the show, just would like to investigate and have you all there to join us for a private hunt for evidence. Very extensive forest area with streams and a small pond with lots of deer.",
