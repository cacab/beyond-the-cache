  "observed": "I have saw what I would call a big foot three times. The first time it was in the fall of 2010. It was late at night. I woke up by my dogs barking. I got up to see what was going on. Thru the screen door I could see a large dark figure walking across my pasture going to my barn. I went back to my bed room and got a gun. I stepped out the door. The creature was a few feet from my barn and I noticed its head was level with the bottom of the roof of my barn. It was very large.  I fired one shot in the air to try to scare it off. It didn't phase it. I then opened fire. It took off running across the pasture running thru 3 strands of wire. One of my dogs took off after it and I followed. I shot 14 40 cal. bullets toward this creature and it didn't slow it down. It disappeared into the corn behind my house. I had goats in the barn. Twice in the fall of 2011 I saw it walking across the field once in the field behind my house once in front. Both time going south to north.",
