  "observed": "I was up north visiting my grandparents over summer break. I was walking back to the house after taking a walk to the boat launch. While coming towards the stop sign, I heard a rustling sound to the side of me. I figured it was leaves in the wind so I kept walking. A few seconds later, I heard the noise again, by now it was getting louder. Thinking it was maybe a deer, I slowly walked towards the treeline. I walked into the trees, and crouched down behind the brush was a large, dark brown colored figure about 50 to 60 yards away. I first assumed it was a bear so I started backing up. It never moved while I was there but I got out of the woods as fast as I could. The next night, I heard howls coming from the woods. I've heard wolf and coyote howls before and this was definitely not one. I have heard many strange howls coming from the woods. Some have been far away but others have sounded very close. Every call has either been a loud low pitched howl or a high pitched cry, sounding like a man screaming. Along with the calls were tree knocks. I never thought much of them until hearing the exact sounds on the show Finding Bigfoot. I honestly don't know what I saw but I believe it was a Bigfoot.",
