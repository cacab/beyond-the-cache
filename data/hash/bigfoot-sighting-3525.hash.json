  "title": "Snowmobiler finds large barefoot tracks in upper peninsula of Michigan",
  "date": "1972-02-25",
  "observed": "While sno-mobiling in a remote area of the county in which I live, I noticed somewhat ahead of me something had walked and left this trail of foot-prints or tracks in the snow. I right away thought this is unusual as people just do not venture into this marshy area. Now this is the 3rd week of Feb., and that winter we had had a heavy fall of snow, and the depth of the snow in that area was around 30 inches. I was able to sno-mobile as the snow had a very hard crust on the surface solid enough to support the weight of the sno-machine without breaking through. So I drove right up on the trail made by something and I stopped and looked down at them. Then I realized these were not black-bear tracks of one coming out of hibernation early, or some person on snow-shoes, or any other familiar thing. These were human bare-foot tracks. The impression left in the snow by whatever walked through there was perfect. The heel mark, the toes, the way the feet taper from wide in the front to narrow by the heel. And thats when the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. A bare-foot giant had walked through there. I saw those prints, and a real fear came over me. And at that time, I had never heard of bigfoot. I had heard of Yeti, in the Himalayas, and Sasquatch in the Pacific north west, but never Bigfoot. I got out of there in a hurry.",
