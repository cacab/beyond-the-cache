  "date": "1978-10-10",
  "observed": "I was outside one morning with my daughter and we were picking up pecans in the yard under the trees.  After about 30 minutes I heard the sound of pigs squealing, screaming.  I looked up and peered through the trees to the wooded back yard of our nearest neighbor.  They had some pigs in a pen at the back of their yard just on the edge of the woods.  I looked in that direction and saw standing there at the edge of their pen, a creature much bigger than a bear or a man.  It was at least about 8 to 10 ft. Tall and was holding one of the baby pigs in its arms.  Holding it close to its chest.  It was hairy like a bear but had a human type face.  I froze and it froze and we both stared at each other, then somehow I thought of my daughter and her safety and I immediately grabbed her and ran inside screaming at my husband to get his gun, there was a Bigfoot outside.  I was hysterical and afraid.  My fear caused him to grab his rifle and run out to investigate.  Of course it was gone.  To this day my husband tells me it was a bear.  But I know better.  I know the difference between the face of a bear and a person, or something like a person.",
