  "date": "2012-05-19",
  "observed": "About a week ago I woke up early in the morning, about 3:30 a.m. to a loud banging noise, like multiple woodblocks slamming. It happened several times for about 10 minutes then ceased. I thought nothing of it. Then two mornings ago I awoke and went out back to let my dog out, around 7 am, and I heard a loud clear whoop noise coming from the same general direction of my back yard. Take note, my back yard is miles of state property containing dense woods, and a canal. I have yet to hear anything like that again.",
