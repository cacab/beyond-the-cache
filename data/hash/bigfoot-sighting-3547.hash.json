  "observed": "We were just teenagers..and working as laborers throwing hay for Old Fat Minteer, who was our boss. I guess we were probably 2/3 fo the way done with the wagon,when I looked over on the other side of the dirt road which parelled the field. What I saw there, I could only describe as what would of been.. something about 7 to 8 feet tall, (we judged this later by the tree it was near. It was standing erect, with it's arms by it's sides, just kinda staring at us. We stopped the tractor, and watched it for about 2 minutes until it wandered off at a brisk pace on two legs. Not once did it make any noise, or any threatning gestures towards us in any way. I told my father about it that evening, as did Lee. He told me, we were probably just seeing things. We told people at school, and they just kind of blew it off as if we had made it up. This is area I grew up hunting and hiking in, and other occasions, we have heard strange howls, cries or moans or what ever you want to call them. I knew the couple times I have heard what ever it was, my hair stood up on the back of my neck. Just typing about it now, I'm getting goosebumps and a cold chill up my back.",
