  "observed": "This is NOT a joke, I'm well known here married to a funeral home director my brother n law is a law enforcement officer. I saw it clearly crossing the road right in front of me, I'm 6'4\" so is my brother n law this creature was considerably taller than me probably 6'8\" shuffling like an orangutan but more human-like but not like a man. It was covered in long hair maybe 4-6 inches long. It was not walking but not running... quickly shuffling. The most distinguishing feature was its arms, slump shouldered and its hands were below its knees. Now here is the deal, I don't drink I don't do drugs, I'm 55 yrs old as of May this year, have three grandbabies and two sons. I'm a christian and have NEVER, EVER, believed in bigfoot. I don't know what this was but i do know this.... it was NOT human, no costume but not 100 percent animal. I SAW IT CLEARLY MYSELF.  Please take this seriously! I don't care if you contact me personally or not but please check this thing out there is something out there i saw it myself. Is it \"bigfoot\" I've no idea but its something... thank you for your time",
