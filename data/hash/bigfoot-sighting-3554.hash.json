  "observed": "About 25 years ago maybe 1972 I was hunting squirrels with a 12 gauge double barrel shotgun. I was sitting on a giant rock when I heard a noise behind me, I saw a big hairy animal approx. 6 to 7 feet tall walking upright. I watched this beast walk about 200 yards until it was out of sight. At this point I was petrified. I waited about 10 minutes then ran home. This was absolutely not a bear and nothing has scared me more since.",
