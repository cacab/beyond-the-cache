  "observed": "I lived on the very top of the mountain. I rode my bike down the dirt road from our house up the next hill, turned my bike around and would pedal down the main road and then coast up the next. As I was coasting up the hill I saw what I thought to be a bear crossing the road. Since I was coasting my bike made no noise. As I got closer I saw this \"thing\" walking across the road. Now I've seen bears walk on 2 legs before so I still didn't think anything about it, except a little afraid of approaching a bear. Well as I was almost right up to this thing I was just going to ride past but I noticed it's hair was longer than a bear, a dark brown with reddish highlights and the hair moved as he moved. But the real difference was when it went to go up an embankment it reached with both hands to grab the tree's branches to help itself up the bank. One hand grabbed one branch, the other grabbed a different branch. It was then that I knew it wasn't a bear. This \"thing\" I don't think heard or saw me. I turned my bike around and peddled as fast as I could. Now I wish I would have stayed there to see what it would have done but I guess I am glad I didn't. I know this has been 25 years ago but I remember it like it was yesterday and I will never forget it.",
