  "observed": "Late at night, in or about July, 1975, I heard a large noise in the woods in front of our house. Although it was dark it was a clear night and quite warm. I looked down into the woods and saw two very large red eyes staring back at me, at first I thought it was a deer but I realized that they were too high up, and I heard what sounded like long slow breaths. I went in and got a flashlight and shined it down there but whatever it was had gone. In the morning I went down to the spot and found no discernable prints but the ground had been heavily trampled. It should be noted that there are many abandoned coke ovens within a quarter mile of here and a fresh running stream right below them. The incident in Zaleski happened years later and involved a feeling of utter terror. I saw nothing but several days later the Columbus Dispatch reported a number of bigfoot sightings were coming from that exact area that was in 1980.",
