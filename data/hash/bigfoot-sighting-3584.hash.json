  "observed": "This story was recently told to me second hand in confidence by a very good friend of mine.  He is an Eagle Scout and an honorable man.  We are avid sportsmen and had spent alot of time together and with other sportsmen in the woods of Pennsylvania.  I told him of my interest in the Florida Skunk Ape.  I asked him if he or any of his family had ever heard or experienced any bigfoot encounters.  He told me that it was ironic that I asked because I was present when his experience occurred.  We were in Boyscouts at the time at a fall campout with our Troop, we were in the same Patrol.  Our Troop was playing \"Capture the Flag\" around dusk.  We were camping at a place called \"Hell's Hollow\" near the Greenville Sportsman Club out on Route 358.  He and another Boyscout went out in the woods to hide.  While they were hiding in some brush, they pushed a Bigfoot that rambled out of the brush and away from them at an alarming rate of speed.  He said it definitely was bipedal and was huge.  My friend stated that he was scared to death and that they made a promise not to tell anyone for fear of ridicule.  He stated that he has never told anyone the story.  I couldn't get any details as to the size or scent.  He did state that he did not see its face.  I told him of my intent to report the story and he said he would discuss it if contacted by the BFRO.
