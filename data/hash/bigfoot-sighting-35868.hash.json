  "observed": "My brother was driving home in the approximate area of  (removed), Monroe, Michigan in a Geo tracker passing sporadic farm houses and other homes otherwise it was pretty dark. The area is semi rural and lighting is poor in some areas. It was approximately 11-11:30 p.m., the night before trash pickup, and many folks had their cans out front of their properties on this particular night.  As he approached a curve my brother who says he’s never spoke about this to his family and only to a close personal friend, observed what he thought was a bear or a very large black dog on all fours in the distance. From the lights of headlamps he said the big black dog appeared to be rooting in the trash and paused only as it caught a glimpse of his approaching headlights. Rounding the curve and heading straight forward he says the black object became clearer and larger as he approached. When he continued forward the animal then on all fours rises on two feet towering above his tiny Geo tracker. It was approximately 7-8 feet tall, black and hairey and looked like it had an ape face with its mouth open as he passed by. My brother said it was so big, so unnatural, it was almost traumatizing. The experience was an unforgettable shock to him. He says as he came side by side with the creature he had to force himself to not look at it as he sped past. As I mentioned he would not report this sighting and does not about it in front of his family. More interestingly, is the fact this sighting occurred...about three or four miles west of the the infamous 1965 “Monroe Monster” sighting.",
