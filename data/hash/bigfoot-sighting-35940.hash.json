  "observed": "This just happened to me about 5:15am this morning. I stepped out on the balcony of my second story apartment I'm in Atlantic Beach fl. I live about 3 to 5 min from Hannah park. I turned on the back porch light as I walked out.  I took about two or three steps out onto the balcony and I heard a loud screaching yell and then three woo whoo whoo noises. As I live and breathe that WAS the sound of a primate!! Immediately the dog in a fence of a neighbor's house right behind the apartment began barking like crazy for about 30 seconds and then stopped. It kind of freaked me out I thought, did an ape escape from Jax zoo or something? I crouched down a little on the balcony and watched the area. In about 5 min I could see the tree in the very back of the apartment back yard rustle a little and it was as if something was moving toward the fence. Then I heard two low grunts from the ground from inside the fence on the neighbors side. It is a privacy fence so I couldn't see what made the grunt. The way the fences are all I could hear were like footsteps moving along the fence toward the trees I saw one shadow really dark moving along the fenceline...it wasn't a person because the shoulders were way too wide and bulky and it wasn't even fully upright. It kind of lumbered along like an ape....people just don't move like that.",
