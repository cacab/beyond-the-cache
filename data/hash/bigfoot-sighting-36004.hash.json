  "observed": "This occurred southeast of Orlando. I was attending an on-site meeting for a new construction project in a very remote and undeveloped area southeast of Orlando. During the meeting, I kept noticing movement in the trees about 150 to 200 yards to the east of our group. I started to pay more attention, and began to realize that this was not a person or animal that I had seen before. It was far too large. It seemed to be ducking in and out behind the trees watching us. It never made a sound and after a couple of minutes, it turned and walked away on two legs into the thicker vegetation. After the meeting, I walked over to the area where I last saw it and the undergrowth was crushed down and you could see where something had passed through. I went to the last tree I saw it at and compared to the limbs on the tree, this thing was at least 7.5 to 8 feet tall. I am 6'2\" and could barely reach the limbs that were at the same height as this creature's head. No one else in the group seemed to notice and I didn't say anything as we were in a high profile professional meeting and I did not want to draw attention to the fact that I thought I was seeing a bigfoot. It would not have been a good thing for my employment situation. I have returned to the area several times as construction has continued, but I have not had any other sightings of this creature.",

  "location_details": "The area is widely cleared and under heavy development now. It is adjacent to an extremely large area of undeveloped land so the creature could easily remain hidden if it chose to do so. This is now an area that is owned by 2 federally regulated utilities."
