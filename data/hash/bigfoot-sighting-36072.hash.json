The other couple took pictures also, then immediately left the park.  The couple appeared to be scared. This was mid-day, we were in the Grayson-Highlands State park in VA. We were on vacation from FL. We saw the dark image move, like it was sqatting down then stood up and appeared to be walking around a tree.  It was in the 40s and very windy.",
