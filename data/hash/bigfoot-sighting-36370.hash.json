  "observed": "Camping out archery hunting with 19 year old son. Heard what sounded like non-descript mumbling outside tent. Thought I was hearing things, went to sleep. Woke to hear foot steps outside tent heading to truck, something rustled around in the truck, thought it was my son. I rolled over to see my son shaking inside his sleeping bag. Before I awoke to the footsteps, he heard at least two different vocalizing/mumbling sounds with walking around our tent. They stopped on my side and he heard a loud vocalization type talking and saw a large hand push in the side of the tent using three fingers, about 4-5 inches. I was snoring and my son thought this might have attracted them. We waited inside the tent for a couple hours and could hear movement outside. Nature called and we both went. I saw one standing behind the truck and he saw one duck behind a tree. We tried staying in the tent for another hour, but they wouldn't go away. I got up went to the truck started it; one was about 30 yards behind truck just watching. We grabbed the tent and everything in it and without breaking it down, threw it in the truck and left. This went on from 11:00pm until 4:00am when we left.",
