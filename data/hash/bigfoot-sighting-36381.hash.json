  "observed": "I'm part of a paranormal group,we were out last night, I heard 3 knocks, didn't think nothing of it at the time, thought people in the woods playing around, but my partner went to take pics in the woods, sat on a park bench, and said he heard some snorts, we thought just a deer or something. Then we sat to do an EVP session, before we started the recorders we heard something kill a deer, then it sounded so close we decided to maybe get out of there, we started to leave and got some eye shine, thought maybe coyotes, but looked at the pics, the eye shine is well over the 3 ft peas growing in the farm field, what's weird is I went out today, and there's nothing in the field disturbed, no blood, no body, no trace of anything?? I know there are no sightings this low in Wisconsin, but still kind of weird! I was thinking you might want to have someone you guys know come check it out, maybe they can find more than i did, it happened Sep. 1, 2012 about 10pm off Fitzsimmons Road in Oak Creek Wisconsin, please email me, I can meet someone and show all I know. Love the show!",
