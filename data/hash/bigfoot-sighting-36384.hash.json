  "title": "Possible track way found in Hosmer Lake near Bend",
  "date": "2012-09-01",
  "observed": "We were paddle boarding at Hosmer Lake and on the far backside of the lake where the water is only about 1 foot deep we saw a track or trail through the water with very clear and apparent large footprints.  The foot was completely decked and toes were clear as day.... We found an easy dozen or more footprints in the water in the mud... Not all were apparent... The trail lasted approx a couple hundred feet ... We saw Elk prints and the 'footprints' seemed to occasionally jolt to the side... As if it were trying to jump onto a fish or duck...  The prints were very large... The water in the lake there is way too cold to walk through....",
