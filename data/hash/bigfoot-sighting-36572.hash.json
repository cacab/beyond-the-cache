  "date": "2012-09-18",
  "observed": "Recently at about 4am I was traveling east out of Fort Scott, Kansas. Just over the Missouri border the road gets narrow with heavy forest almost coming up to the edge of it. Ahead of me at the end of my headlights I saw something run across the road on 2 legs. It was covered with thick brown hair and it had to be big because in just 2 or 3 steps it was across the road and gone into the forest on the other side. It wasn't a bear or a farm animal because they run on 4 legs. And it wasn't a man either unless he had never had a shave or a haircut in his life. A man might be able to run fast, but he couldn't possibly have a stride long enough to come out of a forest, cross a road, and disappear again into the forest on the other side in just a couple of seconds. I only got a glimpse of it for just 2 or 3 seconds but I know what I saw and it wasn't like anything I'd ever seen or heard of outside of things associated with Bigfoot.",
