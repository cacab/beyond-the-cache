  "observed": "My wife and I spent all summer camping at the thousand trails resort in Plain WA.On the night of September 22 2012, we were spending time out by the camp fire. The campground was mostly empty. This is a very large campground 18 miles west of Leavenworth WA. It was around 11:30PM at night. We were drinking coffee and enjoying the warm starlit evening. I noticed a very strong sulfur musty smell. My wife said, \"Do you smell that?\" I told her that I did. In my 40 years of being in the northwest woods I have never smelled anything like it. In a few minutes, a medium piece of wood came flying into the camp. This piece of wood hit our trailer and bounced off it, and landed on our wood pile. We both were in shock. My wife said,  \"What the hell was that!?\" We both looked at each other and said, \" You don't think it was you know who?\" The smell left, but in a few minutes it came back. I asked my wife where my NIKON was. It was at this point that a rock came flying into camp. There were major fires all around us at the time. The animals in that part of the woods were majorly displaced during this time. There is more to this story. We would like to talk with a researcher to tell the rest.",
