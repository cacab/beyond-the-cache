  "observed": "I'm a Native American from Montana. I live on the Flathead Indian Reservation. About two years ago I was hunting up on your mission mountains. The spot I was hunting is called North Crow. I was driving up through there looking for deer. I was coming to this corner and out of the corner of my left eye I seen him standing close to the road but still in a little bit of trees. I knew what it was. About a mile up the road ends, I knew I had to come back down. I was so scared to go back down but I knew I had to. I was driving pretty fast back down and did not look anywhere, just eyes on the road. I did not want to see him again. Have not been up there since this story I'm about to tell you is why I'm getting a hold of you guys. My little brother and my little sister and her boyfriend went hunting above Dixon. They ran into some elk and my little brother shot one. They were siting there gutting it out when a big rock was thrown on to the road. They said the rock was big, at least a 100 pound rock. They said the rock did not roll down, it was thrown. There is a lot of people around here that have seen and heard stuff too. You can call me and I can tell you more.",
