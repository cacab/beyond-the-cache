  "observed": "Ex wife and I saw 2 hairy upright figures walking across the lake from us.... We had parked to stretch our legs a bit and were standing next to Monte Cristo lake in Snohomish county... My wife points across and asks what those are.  I look and see two hairy creatures walking upright and they were almost a golden brown color... I ran to the car to get camera and binoculars ... When  I got back, both were just walking into thick brush... I wanted to go in after them but my wife was too scared.... Never was able to get back to find track or other signs...",
