  "observed": "I was taking my 4 year old cousin for a ride on the ATV. We were climbing an old cattle road; it was a hill. About halfway up the hill I heard this loud thumping noise. I turned around and saw this huge brown hairy manlike creature running up the hill after us; he was at least 10 feet tall. In its hands was what appeared to be a small log. I was only going about 10 MPH and it was fairly close behind us. Finally we got to the top of the hill into this grass opening and I laid on the gas. I was up to about 30 MPH. Its wasn't close to us but it wasn't far away. At the time we were almost out of the field it hurled the log at us. It landed fairly far away. I came back the next day and the log was not there.",
