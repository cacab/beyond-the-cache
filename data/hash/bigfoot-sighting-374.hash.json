  "observed": "My sister Mary and I were heading to work at an early morning hour driving northeast on County Road 19 out of Calais, Ohio. My sister was lying back in the passenger seat when I noticed in my car headlights on the left side of the road the head of an animal in the creek bed. I said out loud what then heck is that? My sister became aware that I was looking at something and starting looking too. As I slowed down to see what it was, it came out of the creek bed on two legs and it ran right towards our car. It then ran along the side of our car (five feet away) for a few seconds. We noticed its brown shaggy hair all over its body and its immense size.  Being very scared, we sped off as quickly as possible fearing the animal was going to jump on our car. When we told people what we had seen, they said all we saw was a horse or a large dog. We both know that whatever this thing was, it ran on two legs, had brown shaggy hair, and was extremely large in size.  We estimate that this thing was close to eight feet tall and over 500 pounds in size. It was hard to get a good look at the face because of darkness and it being so close to the car.  There is no way it was a bear or a person.",
