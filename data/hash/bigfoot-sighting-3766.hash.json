  "observed": "I don't wanna disclose that actual location because of potential bigfoot killers. We were in a enchanted, mossy and fern over grown forest. When we heard(me, mother,father, 4 brothers, 1 sister and a friend) all heard a loud hair raising scream some what like that of a pterodactyl dinosaur. somewhat like a sucking in sound. it was very long like from something with very massive lung capacity. There was a pause between each scream there were four screams total. my mother attempted to imitate the sound and it replied back each time. Earlier that day were took pictures of what were believed to be 2 sets of tracks down a road about a mile from where we heard the screams. The tracks one a smaller and a larger set. The forest was very old with huge trees that had fallen with other trees the same size growing out of them. some trees were so huge I could not see over the fallen one and I am 5'7. There was not sound in this forest it was completely silent. Very eerie. The only sign of wildlife was foot long slugs. the soil was very dark and rich. the moss was think. I put my finger through some moss to see how thick it was and my finger did not touch the ground.",
