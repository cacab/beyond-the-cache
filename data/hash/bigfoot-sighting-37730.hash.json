  "observed": "I was driving down a gravel road late at night and this big black thing ran across the road. I instantly got chills especially because it looked at me while darting across the road it had a face I will never forget. It did not run on two legs, however more like on feet and hands, not knees and hands feet and hands. Behind my house I always hear what sounds like hammering and screaming late at night in the woods.",
