  "title": "Description of several strange encounters along Sleeping Bear Dunes National Shoreline",
  "date": "2010-08-01",
  "observed": "It was too dark for visual. We had rocks thrown at our boat from shore. Shore is all forest and swamp. Man can not access it . It ran away from us after we started the boat to get the hell out of there. Incident #2. 2 miles farther down road. Looking at stars 2 am. Tree violently shaking then snapped in two. Growling.  No sign of bear in the area. #3 2011. Turkey hunting. 10 miles north of the other 2 incidents. Off M-22. Bass Otter Lake. Started raining. Air was clean. Crisp. When it started raining. The stench in air was worse than a bear. Cannot describe it other than bad body order coupled with feces and rotting meat all balled up into 1 bad funk. At the time all wildlife and woods were unbelievably silent. Heard snapping sticks and someone walking. But it was not on 4 legs. Could tell by the sound. I got freaked out like I was being watched. Got the hell out of there. Have not been back since. Won't go back unless I'm armed.",
