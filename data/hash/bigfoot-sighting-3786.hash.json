  "title": "Bow hunters find footprint and hear vocalizations near Indian Heaven Wilderness",
  "date": "2000-09-15",
  "observed": "I am an archer/hunter who hunts elk in the Mt. Adams region of WA and I have two incidents to report; one of personal observation and one of dependable hearsay. First, my hunting partner and I were washing in a stream on the FR88 out of Trout Lake, and we both saw a very clear footprint on the side of the stream. There were no dislodged rocks nearby, and it was not the front and rear tracks of a bear. The track was too large for black bear. Second, my hunting partner, while hunting near the same location (by the junction of the Sawtooth Berry Fields), heard calls that ascended in pitch to make a \"whoop whoop\" sound, and then the banging of a stick against a tree, as if to signal others. He is convinced the sound was not made by a human. My hunting buddy is an FAA air traffic supervisor, and I am a salesman. We both would be able to produce witnesses to vouch for our integrity and sanity.",
