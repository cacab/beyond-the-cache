  "observed": "Two white big foot spotted in open field from car. These creatures were appx. seven and nine feet tall. The shorter a gorilla shape and female, the taller a more human shaped muscular brute head more rounded than female also. Froze in mid stride as deer will do when caught in similar spot. As a rural resident and outdoorsman I was not shocked by them at all. This area has wolverine and cougar in it that once were deemed extinct from Mn. Did not get out to investigate as I was lightly armed and in awe of their size. Would compare to Clydesdale horses in height. Would presume the creatures were in annual migration from wisconsin just like the bears.You will find reports on them to be more active moving east to west from mid August to October. Bears den on the cold [north] side of a slope. So this bigfoot likely uses the south side. Once had hell scared out of my dog by a small black creature that appeared to be sitting on ground with legs crossed eating. This was so near dark and before I saw the big ones that I assumed that the shadows in the forest \"created \" the little guy. Now I'm not so sure. Anyway!!!! If you want to photo bigfoot I suggest the area around the St. Croix river at dusk in early autumn. The French explorer traders called this area passe a'lours - passage of the bears. There are a lot of these creatures out there. Nosey bears could be a problem for the hunt however.",
