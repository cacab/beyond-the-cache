  "date": "2012-11-09",
  "observed": "I was bow hunting 20 ft up in a oak tree and could see 1/4 mile in most directions. It was in the bottomlands of the Illinois River in the country. I heard a noise about 40 yards from me in the thicket I figured it was a buck chasing a doe,,, A minute later a large gorilla looking creature appeared walking south to north at about 7am he was about 7 feet tall and was dark brown. He stayed within the thicket but saw him clearly for 20 seconds or so. The land is rich farmland full of deer, turkey, coyotes, raccoon, possum etc There is creeks and the river. I believe the creature came from the pines a very thick area and was heading for the river. It never said a word just kept moving. But my son has heard 'sounds' while hunting but I have not.",
