  "title": "A loud, unknown vocalization startles solo hiker on shore of Goat Lake",
  "date": "2008-09-13",
  "observed": "Vocalization at close range with no actual sighting. Sunning at end of lake where the trail becomes brushy.  Suddenly without any other sign/signal of someone/something being there, there was a loud vocalization starting with a low pitch howl increasing to high pitch howl almost ending in a high pitch hoop sound. Then dead silence. I jumped up and couldn't see anything but from the lakeshore the trail was pretty obscured and the woods thick. Sound was very close- I estimate 50-75 feet at most.  I grabbed my belongings and got out of there fast hiking all the way back to my truck without stopping except to look back and listen a few times briefly.  Beyond spooky, and puzzling. I have listened to many animal recordings online and nothing native to or not native to WA state sounds even close to this. It does sound strikingly similar to a couple of the recordings I have listened to on the website. I have no doubt I heard something that day that is outside of what species we know to exist in this part of the world. I took me this long because I can't stop thinking of it and when in the woods it has changed the way I view hiking alone, more wary and alert  now, sometimes afraid even.",
