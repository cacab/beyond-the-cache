All of these have taken place within 500 yards of my house.  Only in December has there ever been any activity and around that time the deer that frequent around my property stop coming around.  I have found many deer skeletons and broken limbs in the area that are above my head.  I can only tell you this.  There is something in my woods and I need help finding what it is.",
