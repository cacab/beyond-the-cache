  "title": "Possible encounter by turkey hunters entering their blinds near McPherson",
  "date": "2009-04-15",
  "observed": "I never thought much about what I heard until I heard some of the sounds made by the finding bigfoot crew.  My buddy and I were going turkey hunting.  It was about 5:00 am and we were just crawling into our hunting blind.  We both heard this load scream.  It sounded just like some of the high pitched sounds made on finding bigfoot.  Neither one of us had ever heard anything like it before or after the incident.  It scared the heck out of the both of us.  We loaded our shotguns as quickly as we could. Another interesting thing about the incident is that there were no turkeys roosting in the trees.  Just a week earlier my buddy had went to scout this spot and there were several turkeys roosting in those same trees.  Something had scared the turkeys from that area.  That is pretty unusual for them to leave a roost this time of year. I have been an avid outdoorsman all my life.  I have heard lots of different critters in my experiences in the outdoors.  I have never heard anything like what I heard that morning.   I think it might have been a bigfoot.",
