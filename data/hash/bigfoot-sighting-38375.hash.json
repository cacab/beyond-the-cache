  "observed": "I was hunting deer with a friend in area 6A north on 260 from Camp Verde then left on fs149 left on fs142 right on fs142D where we set up camp in 1989. On the third morning right at dusk we headed out to hunt some deer, I told my friend to hike up this mountain and follow it until he comes down on the other side, and I would hike up mid way and do the same in hope of spooking up some deer. We were to meet on the back side at the bottom the mountain and top side of a wash. After about 10 minutes into the hunt I saw a Fox to my right and ahead of me, he was about 70 yards away and heading in the same direction but in front of me . I kept watching him and ever so often he would stop and turn around the opposite of me and look back. I looked back over my right shoulder and about 120 yards away I saw this figure brownish black in color about 7 to 8 ft tall and very broad walking down in the wash. It was looking at me and continued walking deeper into the wash to where I couldn't see him any more. I only saw him for about 5 to 8 seconds. I wish until this day that I would have used the scope on my rifle up and got a real close up. I told my friend about this but nobody else until about 15 years later. The creature seemed to not want anything to do with me and I of it. I think that the fox was spooked from the creature and surely not me.  We hunted that same area for a few more days and several years after that and I never saw anything like it since.  ",
