  "title": "Footprints found along snow covered road near Whiskeytown Lake",
  "date": "2013-01-07",
  "observed": "Three friends enjoying an all day ride up to the snow in Whiskeytown National Park. We were all on horseback. We spotted what appeared to be Bigfoot tracks in the snow. We got off our horses for close examination and could clearly see the toes in the snow. Two of the witnesses are RN's. I am an Appraiser. What made this sighting of tracks credible to me were the existence of so many other tracks, including bear, that gave good comparison to other critters and size.  The tracks came up out from the gulch, followed the road a bit, then back down into the gulch. Also my friend noticed smaller Bigfoot tracks coming down from a very steep draw on the left of the road. There were no tracks going up, just coming down, as if to \"join\" the others. It was still very cold when we first saw these tracks, but they were melting when we rode back through this area many hours later.",
