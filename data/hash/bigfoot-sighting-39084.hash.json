  "observed": "Hi, I am 47 years old and I am a truck driver. I had an eye witness of something yesterday January 16 2013 in Clark Co. Ill.  I was driving down I-70 east bound around 7:30 am  when I noticed something in the field about 200-300 yards away.  It was black in color, fairly big but seemed to be squatted down with its back to me. At first I thought it was a bear but as I got closer its form resembled more of an ape like form.  Then before I passed it, it began to move away toward the woods.  As it moved it was moving like if you were to squat down and then try to walk while squatted.  I can't say that it was a big foot but I have no other explanation for it.  I have been hunting since I was 15 years old and I have seen a lot of animals but I have never seen anything like this and the way it moved.",
