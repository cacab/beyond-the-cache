  "observed": "I was down at our tank hunting rabbits and I shot once and missed, so I quickly shot again. As soon as I shot the rabbit, I walked towards it to make sure it was dead. At that time, a huge black figure took off running through the woods; and it was so fast that it was gone in a matter of seconds. I grabbed the rabbit and ran back up to our house. I didn't go back down to our tank for at least half a year.",
