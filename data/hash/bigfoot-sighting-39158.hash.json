  "title": "Recollection of a daylight sighting while riding mini-bikes near Chardon",
  "date": "2004-07-01",
  "observed": "My friend and I were heading down the trail on our mini bikes when we parked on the trail for a bathroom stop. We both went off to the left side of the trail and were still walking side by side. As we were walking, we were startled when a figure jumped out of a tree no more then 20-30 feet in front of us in the direction we were headed. The figure landed facing us on 2 feet and was very obvious it was like nothing we had ever seen before. I do not believe it was an adult due to the fact it was only about 5 ft. tall. It had brown hair all over its body and just stared at us. After about 5 seconds or so we freaked out and ran for our bikes and took off. We saw this thing in broad daylight at a close range. I think it may have thought we saw him and we were approaching him and that's why he jumped? We had no clue it was there till he made the leap.",
