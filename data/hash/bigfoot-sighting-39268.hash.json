  "observed": "I had just gotten my son down to sleep. It was 1 o'clock in the morning. He sleeps in the back bedroom. I happened to walk by the window in the hallway because I had to go to the bathroom. For some reason I heard a cough. It sounded like somebody clearing their throat. I had just put the pool down. We have one of those quick set ring pools that you blow up for my son. I just took it down and it was drying off, I thought somebody was out there looking at it or messing with it. So I opened the blinds and looked. I didn't see anything right off the bat. But then I saw something between the woods and my shed. It was just standing there and it was big. The head looked huge. So I ran upstairs and got my night vision. When I kicked that night vision on I could see every detail. It was staring up in the trees. He was at least eight and a half foot tall. He was about 40 yards from the window. He looked gray in color. It looked like a really big human. If people want to know what the face looks like, if you put this guy in a Viking movie with a horned helmet on people would say he was a Viking, that's how human looking he was. He had really sunken eyes. But he was just looking up in the trees. And then I heard somebody's radio down at the parking lot of the bike trail. It was pretty amazing. I was watching him and thinking \"He's hanging out there because he's waiting for people to leave.\" Nobody could see him there, and the only reason I did is because I was walking by the window and saw something in my yard that is not normally there. I even went to wake my wife and have her see too, but he was gone.",
