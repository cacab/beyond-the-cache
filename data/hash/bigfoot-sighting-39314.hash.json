  "observed": "Saw the report of wood knocking on Fitzsimmons Road in Oak Creek WI and wanted to comment that I experienced this in the very same area back in 1976 or so. I was with 3 friends parked at the cul de sac that used to be right off Fitz between the RR tracks and lake. The short stretch went north about 1/4 mile or less. There was one streetlight at the end of the road - nothing else. Back then, there were no walking paths - the area was more remote than today. It was late in the summer - well past dusk. Probably between 9 - 10pm. We were hanging out outside the vehicle. We hear a series of wood knocks in the distance - didn't give it much though. After several minutes, another series, only closer. Close enough it got our attention and we commented. A few more minutes and now a series of 2 or 3 knocks very loud and close. We bagged it into the truck and got out of there. If it was someone messing with us, I don't know where they could have come from or how they could move through the woods in total darkness.",
