  "observed": "My sighting happened last summer. I was kayaking down a creek. It was about the middle of the day. I was comin down the creek. The creek I was coming down is deep in some parts and shallow in some. There are always deer and turkey moving through. When I came around the curve in the creek a splash happened right in front of me. I thought it may have been a fish. So I kept paddling. Then three more splashes hit by me. The last splash I saw it was a rock. So I slowed down in the creek to look. I started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I've seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn't bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance. So I couldn't see it.",
