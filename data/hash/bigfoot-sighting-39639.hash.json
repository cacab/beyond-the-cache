  "date": "1991-07-01",
  "observed": "I and about 7 other campers heard a very loud growl that quickly changed into a long-lasting howl.  To be safe, we all retreated to our cars for a while because we had no idea what could have made a sound like what we heard. I’m reporting this twenty years after the fact because we all just wrote it off as a wild animal or a bear, but after seeing the TV show “Finding Bigfoot” for the first time, and hearing BoBo cut loose with one of his calls, I made the connection that the sound I heard twenty years ago sounded almost exactly like BoBo’s call. What I heard was very loud and very close.  After researching Black Bear sounds on the internet, this wasn't even close. I didn't smell anything.",
