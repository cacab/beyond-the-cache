  "observed": "I have worked as a wilderness guide for about eight years, many of which where spent in Katmai National Park and the Yukon delta. So it's fair to say I know what lives in the woods, and the behavior of the woods. I will make my story brief. My experience happened in Washington state, mid summer back in 2003. A close friend and myself decided to go shoot some ground fowl in the Indianola area of Wa. After entering a clearing some 1000ft open, we stopped to smoke a cig. I must note the air was still and damp, and I could smell death of a creature close by.  Some time during the smoke I had movement in the corner of my eye. An animal stood 400 or so ft away from me. I know what a bear looks like, I worked as a Brooks River guide. It was not a bear. It was not a person. I'm 6ft 4. It was much much larger and beefier than me. It was not someone messing around. I was armed. But I can say that animal had a stride not matched in North America. It did walk some 200ft from the left to right in my vision. I was not going to shoot it. I wanted nothing to do with it. Needless to say we exited back to the truck back to back. I have not spoke of this due to the fact it would taint my career as a wilderness guide. But note I have nothing to gain or loose, but that animal I saw was your Bigfoot.",
