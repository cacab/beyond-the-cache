  "observed": "Hello BFRO I have something I would like to share with you I believe I have see what people and myself call bigfoot . The first time was on a night time coon hunt. I hunt coons with traps and dogs yet I don't kill them. I let my dogs tree them and I go on to another track with my dog . I had hunted this bottom a night before and my dog was hot on a track deep in the woods bawlen the whole track when he shut up and not a sound from him for twenty minutes. Then all the sudden he came up the creek with his tail between his legs looking back and came straight to me. Ok first this is a hound who has never ran anything but coons and has never stopped tracking with out treeing, anyway, so I thought maybe he got spooked by a bobcat or something so I loaded him up and went home not thinking anything about it. The next evening on the 12th I pulled into the same open field in a bottom where two creeks join. I shined my lights of my truck along the trees of the creeks to see if I could spot some coon and low and behold I saw what I believe was a bigfoot in my head lights at about 75 yards was a enormous blackish brown figure was walking toward the trees through the field to the creek it stopped for a brief moment and just stared at me like it was looking right at me and took large lengthy steps into the woods. I was startled and not only was I startled but my hound in my back seat was startled as well whining and whimpering. I know what me and my hound saw and my dog hasn't ever backed down from an animal as long as I've had it and I've spent countless of hours in the timber with him. [The following was taken from this witness' second BFRO report, after returning to the site :] After talking to the BFRO rep I decided I would go back to the location I had my sighting on the12th, and sat in the exact place I was. Tonight when I got there, there was tracks crossing the road from the north to the south and they were wet and large foot prints. Its 18 degrees here, clearly not a humans tracks. There were 5 prints, one in front of the other, which was rather weird and I do have the pictures of them but their really hard to make out . It was awesome, I got some wood knock responses that were really close across the highway from me, the directions the prints were. I  shined the area and yet I never seen anything. I know what I heard. I'm going to keep squatching the area and a few others to hopefully get a picture of the squatch I saw on the 12th. I consider myself a very very good hunter and I am going to put some of my game cams in the area as well as camo up and sit in the area. I was rather timid tonight on the phone with the BFRO, due to the way people feel about it around here, but I know what I saw and heard.",
