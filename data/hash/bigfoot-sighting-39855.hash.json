  "observed": "My father and I work as a team while deer hunting. We go into the woods, travel a short distance and stand apart to stalk feeding or resting deer. If we jump a deer the other stays off to one side so that he may sight the deer if it should turn to escape. After leaving Dad that morning, out of the corner of my eye I noticed a 7 1/2 foot tall hairy dark brown animal with a red tint; he never stopped, never looked at me, just kept walking. I froze I couldn't even move, I was able to watch him for 5 or 6 seconds then he just disappeared into the trees. This was truly a mind changing occurrence. I've always not believed in Bigfoot. But now I do, and I would love to have this encounter again",
