  "observed": "I am writing this for my daughter. She was driving and came to a stop sign. This is a T road so she has to turn left or right. Straight in front of her is an open field with trees on the edge of it and a creek after the trees. After she stopped at the stop sign she noticed several deer running very fast. She then noticed a large creature running after them. She stated it was very, very tall on 2 legs and very, very hairy. The deer and the bigfoot ran into the trees. She was scared and was home in minutes. We live about 2 miles from where she saw bigfoot. She told Dad & I what happened. I explained to her what she had seen and told her that she was lucky to see it because not everybody gets to see them. Of course she didn't feel that way.",
