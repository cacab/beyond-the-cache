  "title": "Possible daylight sighting along I-90 near Geneva",
  "date": "2013-03-14",
  "observed": "I was simply driving east on route 90, I had just passed the Lake County/Ashtabula County border and I was looking around as I usually do and I look over at this woodline hoping to see some deer or turkey and to my surprise there was what looked to be a Bigfoot walking through the woods about 100 yards from the roadway. At first I thought I was imagining things but other drivers slowed to look as well. It was about 3:10pm and the weather was partly cloudy, the temp was about 33 degrees and there was a dusting of snow on the ground. The Bigfoot was tall about 9-11 feet if I had to guess and it had broad shoulders and it was brownish grey in color. It was walking east then turned south toward the Grand River. I told others about this and some think I'm crazy and others believe me. I do hope to see it again, I was amazed yet unsettled at the same time.",
