  "observed": "My sister and I were driving North on Hwy 67 just past Rushville, Illinois. It was about 3 am, we came up on a part of the road that veered left in a wooded area.  I saw an image up ahead in the road so I started to slow down. At first I thought it was a big big bear but I realized it was slimmer with very broad shoulders and black. It was bending down standing on the back legs, it picked something up out of the road with great care, looked right up at us and then took off so fast in the woods on its two back legs standing up caring for whatever it was that it picked up. My lights shined on it, it was not a bear. I've never seen an animal like that before and I have traveled the roads a lot. I've been hesitant to say anything because it just sounds crazy but it still bothers me because I don't know what it was. My sister saw it as well.",
