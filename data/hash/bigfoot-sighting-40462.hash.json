  "date": "2012-12-29",
  "observed": "I was driving home from my girl friends house in Pennsgrove, NJ. I was between Pedrick Town and Auburn when I was approaching a stop sign I noticed something reflective by a telephone pole. I thought it was reflectors on the pole itself but as I grew closer I realized the size and stature of the figure. What I thought were reflectors were eyes and it took off into the woods. I got out of the truck right at the pole and heard grunting a screech and a grunt off into the woods. Anyone familiar with the area knows it is woodsy and remote.",
