  "observed": "I was deer hunting last weekend when I noticed some tracks. I followed the tracks to a hidden waterhole in a very dry place where you would not normally find water. The tracks measure about 16 inches long and 10 inches wide. there are at least 50 oor more tracks leading up the hill. I think I found some of his dung and it was very hard on the outside and still semi-soft on the inside, and it has a very one of a kind smell. It does not smell bad, it almost smells sweet. I have been hunting these woods for over 20 yrs, never have I seen anything like this.  I do have some of the dung with me in a ziploc bag if someone would like to test it. The tracks look as if he is still using them over and over again because the area is very dry and when you step in the tracks it is real quiet. The water hole was a little murky but could have been other animals but I believe I might have just missed him!",
