  "observed": "It was raining and I thought I was coming up on someone walking in the ditch wearing a hooded rain slicker. As I got closer I thought what an idiot, they are wearing a fur coat. I thought I was looking at the back of someone but when I got even with them I noticed that it was not the back of someone standing but the side of something bending down. Just as I got even with it, it stood up and lifted its arms up as if making a tee like a cheerleader would. That's when I noticed what I believe was a deer between its legs. It all happened very fast as I was going about 55mph and only slowed down briefly. I took my foot off the brake and continued home. My own wife laughed at me about it but I know what I saw can not be explained.",
