  "observed": "NW Florida, March 22, 2013. Me and my brother were driving South (me behind the wheel) on Hwy 85 about 7 miles south of Crestview Florida at 1:30am when we spotted what at first we thought was a really big black bear on the side of the road (West shoulder) next to the woods. I decided to make a U-turn at the next open medium to get a better look as big bear sightings in this area are not all that common; Usually they are very small black bears. We took a U-turn at an open medium about a 1/2 mile from the initial sighting and started heading back North. We got to the point where we had first seen what we thought was a large bear and started looking across the median for it. My Brother looked to his right and spotted the thing that we had seen. It had apparently crossed the highway putting it now on the East side of the road. When we looked we saw a large upright walking (like a human) black big foot type of creature. It paused, looked like it turned its head toward us, and ran into the woods. It was too large to be a human and it definately was not a bear. I'd guesstimate approx. 8' 6\" to 9' tall.",
