  "observed": "I was driving home from Macomb Illinois and looked out in the field (mostly checking to make sure there were no deer) when I saw  some type of animal, I have never seen before. It was on all fours, long haired, bigger than a dog but smaller than a buck -deer. It was long haired, light colored, and just standing in the field. It took me a minute to comprehend it. Didn't really look like the right terrain but I looked at info and saw one had been sighted close by in 2012.",
