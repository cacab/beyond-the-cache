  "title": "Memory told of a large hairy biped approaching a family as they dumped their garbage near Waukeenah",
  "date": "1975-08-01",
  "observed": "I have been interested in this for years because in my family it was taken as fact for most of my life. The reason for this was an incident that happened in the early seventies, 1974, I believe. It happened just west of Waukeena Florida off the old St. Augustine road, a dirt road that parallels U.S. 27. My grandmother (now deceased), my mother, my younger sister and supposedly me (though for some reason I swear I don't remember it at all) were at a place where people dumped trash. We had thrown some stuff away and were looking at some things that others had tossed. My mother is 80 and still remembers this vividly and so does my sister. My sister says it was a Bigfoot! My Mom tells the story that it was a \"big ole hairy hippie!\" More like a man than an ape. When she was alive my grandma had a similar story. My Mom says it was a great big man (when I ask how big it was she says WAY bigger than you are...I'm 6'4\" 320lbs) who was all the way naked (she says you could see it was male) and didn't have shoes or anything else on. He was hairy all over with tangled reddish brown hair. This happened in full daylight with the creature approaching us from the wood line in an aggressive manner (grunting and making sounds) at a fairly close distance. Everyone retreated to my Grandma's old Chevy and by the time we got moving we were face to face at smelling distance. My Mom and Sis say it smelled like rotten eggs or meat or something really unforgettably bad. I wanted to tell this story because my mom is 80 years old and I want her side of this to be told. She says it was a man, maybe somebody who is crazy or something. She is an old Hillbilly and has no modern frame of reference. I wish I could remember this event directly myself but can't. My sister who's 18 months younger than me recalls it perfectly and they both say I was there.",
