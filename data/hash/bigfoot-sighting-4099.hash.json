  "observed": "My friend and I were out arrowhead hunting. It was late September 1985. We were driving looking for a good spot when I spotted a ridge that was a wash out. I told her to pull over and hunt there because it was off the beaten path. I climbed to the top and spied a cornfield. So we proceeded to hunt the field. The corn stalks were small that year and you could see the whole area. In the fence row was what I thought was a black tree that was topped off.   But, I kept getting the feeling I was being watched. At closer observation of the object it was like it was grinning at me. This was in the space of a half an hour. I looked around for my friend and she was nowhere to be found. So I beat it back to her car. She was right behind me. She said, \"Did you see that?\" And I said half jokingly, \"what Bigfoot?\" She said, \"you seen it too?\" I told her I thought it was a tree that was cut off at the top. But, I had the creepy feling someone was watching me,and kept looking back at it. We drove around and I said we have to go back. We did and my \"tree\" was gone. I've told different people about it. They think I'm nuts I'm glad I wasn't the only one there. I rarely see her but every time I do she always brings it up. ",
