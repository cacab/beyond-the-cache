  "observed": "A friend and I was camping at Arrowhead Campground at Uwharrie Nat Forrest. We heard something in the woods on the outskirts of the camp probing the camping area. The next morning my friend asked me if I heard something. I told him that I did and I just did not think anything about it. I asked him what he thought it was. He said it was definately walking on two feet and it was not a person. By the sound of the breaking branches he said it had to be big. It was late October and the ground had a lot of leaves and sticks on the ground. We where at campsites 14a and 14b if I recall correctly. Arrowhead Campground is located near Badin Lake and wildlife is abundant including deer. My friend was a skeptical before that but he was a little stifled by the sounds we heard that night. I asked him if it could have been a horse wandering from the above horse camp or a bear and he said it was walking on two feet like a man but had to be much larger because of the amount of noise of the breaking branches and leaves. We were only around 10 meters from the wood line. We are both professionals in our jobs and he is very trustworthy. I am an Army veteran a have a lot of time in the woods of N.C. GA. TN.",
