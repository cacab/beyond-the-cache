  "observed": "My son, his best friend, and myself were driving on a short logging road that crests over a hill and dead ends at the bottom. We had just crested the hill when we saw a large, black hairy creature start running at the bottom of the clear cut towards the timber line. The creature was approximately six to seven feet tall and running on two legs. We were approximately 200 yards from it when it started running. It ran a distance of about 100 yards to the timber line in only about 4 seconds, across uneven terrain. The time was about 8:30pm. We came back the next morning but could not find any tracks of the creature.",
