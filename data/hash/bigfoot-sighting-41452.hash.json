  "observed": "6/17/13- Salt Fork State Park Bigfoot Ridge. Me and my girlfriend went to bed at about 10pm. Off and on we heard really weird loud screams. At about 1 am she woke me up in terror because it was outside our tent just feet from our heads pulling handfuls of grass. She was frozen with fear and waited for it to walk away. When it did she opened the tent where she heard twigs cracking and shined the flashlight in that direction when she saw its really big yellow eyes. They were close together and it turned towards the wooded tree line. We believe it watched us grab our stuff and end the trip early. We left our tent and hauled it out of there fast. We are completely traumatized over the experience and would like to talk to someone who believes. We also believe we attracted it because I was knocking trees just after sunset.",
