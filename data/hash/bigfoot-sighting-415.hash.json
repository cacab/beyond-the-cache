  "observed": "A friend and I were useing a wounded rabbit call to call up coyoties. We were sitting in a field, about an acre. this thing came up and it sounded like it started to belly ache, I figured, because we were in the field. I have been inside the lion house at feeding time, those lions didn't have anything on this thing! We never saw it, it wouldn't step out into the light, but it cried about 12 to 15 times, when it stoped I really worried where it was and what it was! I left and didn't go back for about two weeks.",
