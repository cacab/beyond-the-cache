  "date": "2013-06-26",
  "observed": "I and two other friends were sitting in their vehicle at Eagle Lake during the evening.  I was sitting in the back seat and our side window was rolled down.  We heard an erie yell, it sounded to me like a bigfoot call.  Only two of us heard it, as I said, our window was down.  We only heard it once, which was enough for me.  I went back the next day with the other friend and found a trail leading to an area with pole-sized trees downed by something, with some going one way, others another and on top of each other.  I don't go on that trail anymore, not even during the day.  That yell was inhuman.",
