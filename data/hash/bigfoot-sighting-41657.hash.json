  "observed": "I was on my way from my house in Stevens Point, Wisconsin to Hayward, WI for a fishing tournament on the Chippewa Flowage. My team partner and I left Stevens point at 3 AM in the morning on Friday, July 12 to practice for the tournament on the following Saturday. The route that I take goes through Phillips, WI. However, I have a shortcut that takes me around the town of Phillips. Specifically, I turn west onto Dama Rd. off of HWY 13. I then take Dama to Mink Ranch Rd. and turn right heading north. I then take another right onto E Wilson Flowage Rd. It is at this point when we saw what we believe may have been a Sasquatch. It was roughly 5:15 AM when I turned onto E Wilson Flowage Rd. When we turned about 70 yards in front of us in the middle of the road was a big black animal that had its rear end facing us. At that point it we startled it and it took a quick look at us and ran into the woods. That's when we both thought we had just seen a gorilla. It was easily six ft tall and when it ran into the woods we could tell that the creature had a 45 degree angled back from head to rear end. Not at all like a bear. Additionally, it ran into the woods using its front two arms like an ape. Using its knuckles like an ape. We continued on with our trip questioning what we saw. I just happened to google Sasquatch in Wisconsin and saw that Phillips is a hot bed for activity. So I had to make a report.",
