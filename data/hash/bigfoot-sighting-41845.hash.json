  "observed": "We went looking for Sasquatch in the woods surrounding our favorite campsite east of Fraser.  To our surprise we actually heard something.  On the first night we heard a very loud tree knock followed by something BIG walking down a slope away from us.  Two nights later we saw red glowing eyes that followed us.  On the third night we heard howling, tree knocking, and grunting.  While one member of our group was taking a pee he said he saw a figure about 5 feet tall start to walk away from him, then it stood up even taller, about eight feet tall.  Heard bi-pedal footsteps following us back to camp.  We left a glow stick on the road when we left.  When we returned to check on it, it had been placed in a hollow tree base.",
