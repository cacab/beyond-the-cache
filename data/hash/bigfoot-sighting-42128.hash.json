  "observed": "Tonight, while on the porch, my better half and myself heard an odd vocal sound.  Then there was a tree crash.  I used a spotlight and checked out the surrounding area and found nothing.  So, just figured a tree fell, no big deal.  Approximately 10 minutes later a LARGE crash from, what I assume to be, a tree was heard further down the road.  I again used  my spotlight and saw nothing.  We sat on the porch for a bit longer and heard rustling off in the woods.  We decided to go inside.",
