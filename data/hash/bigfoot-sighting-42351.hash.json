  "observed": "We received a voice mail from a witness, and he stated \"I live near Lake City on 66. It's really weird because I'm having some stuff happen out here, and I was really wondering if there is somebody in my area. I'm right by Missaukee Mountain and its all forest and swamps.\" I am Investigator Kim Fleming and I am filing this report on behalf of the witness.  I returned the witness' phone call and can add: There is ongoing activity near the home since early spring of 2013.  The witness' first encounter was while walking in an area of pines.  He heard a wood knock so loud that it frightened him significantly.  He actually thought he had been shot at.  He also heard several whistles coming from an area of the woods where he regularly walks.  Several sets of tracks have been found, large and small.",
