  "observed": "I am 28 yrs old, a U.S. Marine Veteran and recently moved to Texas last April.  I didn't see anything, but I feel I heard vocals.  I was hunting on opening of rifle season for whitetail deer in east Texas, Jasper county.  It was about 5 am and I just climbed into my deer blind.  about 15 minutes after I sat down I heard a very distinct med-high pitch howl no more than 100-150 yards away to the left.  it was about the same pitch as a coyote call, but it maintained a constant pitch and suddenly stopped.  It lasted for about 5 seconds.  about 5-10 seconds later I heard a response call that was a much lower tone at the same distance to the right.  It was about the tone of an owl, but again, maintained a consistent pitch that just stopped and it didn't have breaks like an owl sound.  Again the response was about 5 seconds.  I shrugged it off thinking this wasn't real.  About 5 min later I got out of my blind and walked to my truck to get binoculars and I thought I heard something that sounded like a person saying, \"Hey You\" but the speech was very low and very gargled.  I thought to myself, \" I will go about my way and leave whatever it is alone and it will probably leave me alone.\"  I got back in my blind and resumed hunting.  I cannot explain what I heard, but I know for a fact it wasn't a coyote or an owl.  I just can't explain it.  Thank you for reading and look forward to hearing from you.",
