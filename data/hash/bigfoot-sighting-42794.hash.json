  "date": "1998-09-28",
  "observed": "I was with a friend, returning home from a baseball game in St. Louis. We were on route 32 in Illinois, just north of the Shumway turnoff by about a mile or so, when a large bi-ped appearing around 9' tall, came running out of a cornfield, crossed a ditch as if it weren't there and crossed the highway in three steps then over another ditch into another cornfield. It appeared to be greyish in color and ran with its arms down in a pendulum type motion. It was approximately 30 yards ahead of us. We both turn to each other at the same time and said, \"Did you see that?\" We slowed down, but it was too dark to see much. We returned late in the afternoon the next day to look for signs, but the area farmers had harvested the corn on both sides of the roads earlier that morning.",
