  "observed": "My best friend and I were driving around one night, about 2:00 am.  We ended up on a little used dead end road.  We were uh, out of the vehicle to releive ourselves, hense the dead end with no houses on it.  We were in themiddle of no-where but why take chances getting spotted? We finished up our business and I was back in the truck waiting for my buddy.  I turned on the headlights, and illuminated in the beams was a very tall man shaped animal, brown in color.  It stood perfectly still for a minute and then grunted at us.  Then it turned and walked away.  it didn't move like a man.  It kind of swaggared back and forth like it lunged each leg forward when it walked. We were really freaked out so we backed up all the way to the road. Afterward, we rationalized that it must have been a moose.  but I don't think it was.  For starters, i've seen moose before and they're huge.  this was tall enough, it looked well over six feet.  But it stood on two legs, and it didn't have antlers.  but at the time, we had to rationalize what we saw. My father is an officer with the NYS Department of Environmental Concervation.  He says that what we saw was a moose.  It could not have been a big foot.  but I disagree.  I went back and searched for moose tracks, none.  Droppings, none but rabbit.  In fact, I found no tracks of any kind. But that doesn't mean anytyhing because the ground is all soft needles and leaves.",
