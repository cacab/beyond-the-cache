  "date": "2013-10-15",
  "observed": "I was bow hunting near my grandfather's house. Early that afternoon around maybe 1:30 I slipped back into a remote section of woods about 1/4 of a mile from the road where I had hung my stand a few days before. After I got there, I didn't see anything other than a couple of squirrels and an opossum. Right as it was starting to get dark I heard something coming through the woods and I thought it was a deer. Once it got to the small clearing that I was in, I saw that is was a bigfoot. It looked like it might have been about 7 foot but it could have been more or less. I think that it was a female because it wasn't extremely broad or blocky looking and it also had visible breasts. It had reddish brown hair. After it passed through the clearing I climbed down from the tree and got out of there as quickly as I could.",
