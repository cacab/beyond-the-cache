  "title": "Memory told of a daylight sighting along railroad tracks east of Plumfield",
  "date": "2013-11-24",
  "observed": "It was about 1977 me and a friend from high school, we had dirt bikes, and the only way you could get to the place with motorcycles,  was to go down some railroad tracks and there at the railroad trestle there is a small creek that ran underneath it. It was cleared off and they used to take care of it because there are high-powered tension lines in there too. We were on our bikes down by the creek and we heard something and we looked up, there was a small hill about sixteen feet high or so that used to go out and climb with our bikes. And we looked up and there was what we call in Illinois - MOMO, it's bigfoot, and it was squatting up and down scratching his back on a tree. It scared us and we hopped on our bikes and took off.",
