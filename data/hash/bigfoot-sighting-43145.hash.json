  "date": "2005-10-22",
  "observed": "Heading west on 17th Rd as I was making a left hand turn onto C Rd. A couple deer ran across the road from my right to the left so as the driver, I was fixated on not hitting the deer. At this time my passenger was looking west (right side of vehicle) and said \"Holy s#!t what is that!\", by the time I looked there was only a large dark upright blob already in the tree line, so I did not get a good look, but my passenger swears it was a sasquatch. He thought it was chasing the deer.",
