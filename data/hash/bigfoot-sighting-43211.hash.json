  "date": "2000-06-10",
  "observed": "My mom and I were driving to my grandparent's house early in the morning when we both saw what appeared to be a gorilla sitting in a field a little ahead of us. As we got closer to the creature we both said \"my god it's a Sasquatch\"!!  It was just sitting in the field with its back to us. It was HUGE!  She was probably going about 45 miles per hour and our biggest regret has been and always will be, not turning around to confirm our gut feeling. We did not see it's face and/or it's whole body because it was sitting and facing the opposite direction. It was big hairy and brown. It's head was oblong and sort of came to a point with no real definition between its head and neck until it's broad shoulders. It's arms were extremely long as well. They were so long the hands were kind of bent beside it's upright body. It was NOT a bear! I would be willing to put money on that it was a gorilla before a bear. It was sitting on its butt just like a person would. People have said we are crazy for years and say it was a bear. The location where we saw the Sasquatch is not a prime bear location!!",
