  "title": "Memory told of sighting at night along SR 108 near Hagaman",
  "date": "2014-05-14",
  "observed": "It was around the year 1989.  I was working at McDonald's in Carlinville, Il and I had closed that night.  I was headed home at around 1:00 a.m. or 2:00 a.m.  I was headed west on IL Hwy 108.  I was going thru an area on the highway known to locals as Hagaman Bottoms.  Just as I was about to approach the bridge at the Bottom of Bell Hill I saw a large creature standing next to the road.  Just as I got near it or just about even with the creature it reached out at my car.  It scared me and I accelerated my car to get away from it.  It was a very bright moonlit night and I could tell that it was dark brown or black in color.  It was also tall as it stood above the top of my car.  The car I owned at the time was a Chevy Celebrity Eurosport.  I remember it standing facing east and when I was passing it it turned south and reached out with its right hand.  This was a very scarey experience for a young girl in a car going home all by herself.",
