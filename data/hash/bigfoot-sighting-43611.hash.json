  "title": "Couple spot possible footprints on Benton MacKaye Trail near Blue Ridge",

  "observed": "My girlfriend and I were on vacation in Blue Ridge, GA. We went hiking the day before and the ground was frozen solid from the weather. The following day we went hiking and it rained the night before. It was very cloudy all day and still pretty cold but the ground was thawing out. We decided to hike the Benton-MacKaye Trail off Highway 515. We started at 8:45 a.m. and followed the trail around to an open field and decided to take a quick break. While on  the break, I yelled as loud as I could twice and the echo was impressive. We continued following the trail for another 1 1/2 hours until we decided to head back. On the way back around the field, we noticed a huge footprint. It was obvious it was a footprint because you could see the toes in the clay. The clay wasn't hard nor was it wet and slick. We passed it on the way and had no walking troubles or saw the print. There were footprints around other than ours, however, we didn't see anybody from the start of the trailhead and throughout the hike.  We looked around for more and discovered 4-5 more tracks the same size, others that looked similar but less defined. It was a very deep print, looked to have 4 toes. It seemed to be walking down the hill towards the creek.",
