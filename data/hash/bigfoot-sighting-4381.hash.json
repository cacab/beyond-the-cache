  "date": "1981-10-15",
  "observed": "It was late fall shortly after sundown, my girlfriend and I went for a walk down the road that ran infront of her house. The weather was cool and the sky was clear. We walked with the shoulder of the road to our right. Slighty off the road, there was a fence row about 6 feet above the level of the road. As we were walking along the road, I heard something 'tramping' around on the fence row. We got spooked. It noise continued. I just had to know what it was so I jumped up on the fence row and looked across a cut corn field. As I looked across the field, I noticed something walking along a ditch. It appeared to be tall and slender with a shaggy brown skin. I hollared at it and it stepped off into a ditch bank. We got scared and ran back to my girlfriends house. The next day, I went back and search through the corn field. I found several large footprints in some left over lime. They were slightly larger than my 12 shoe and appeared to be a barefoot human, except bigger. A few weeks later, my girlfriend was walking around a pond near an old homeplace. We heard something walking through the woods. It didn't sound like a deer or a man. It sounded different. We stayed a few minutes listening to this 'something' walk through the woods. Feeling kinda on edge, we left. Over the next few weeks, I kept an eye out for anything unusual, but didn't find anything.",
