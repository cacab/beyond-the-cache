  "title": "Horse trainer hears frightening vocalizations near Shelton",
  "date": "2014-01-15",
  "observed": "January 15, 2014 approximately 5:30 pm. I had been burning yard debris on the back of our property, east of Shelton, Wa.  We have a horse training facility on 6 acres backed up to a densely wooded hillside with a wetland on the southeast corner of our property. My burn pile was just west of the wetland area.  After I had fed the horses and closed up the barn I went to tend to the fire as I was standing there is when I heard a call, the closest thing I can compare it to is a howler monkey/ whooping crane mix type call with a low (almost subsonic) growl or rumble that was mostly felt, not audible.  The first call I didn't quite pay attention to, however the second call made my hair stand on end, and it was close (I would guesstimate within 100 yards). It was dark and because of the fire all I could see in that direction was darkness but I felt that I was being watched and possibly being called to. The call was not strained as in trying to carry distance but just to be heard.  I was frozen for a moment then I turned and quickly headed to the house when I heard the call one more time.  I have always been very much at home in the wilderness and have heard many different kind of critters but this was different and worth reporting.",
