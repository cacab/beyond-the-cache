  "observed": "I saw a large figure walking through the tree line. About 7-7.5 feet tall. I was about 20-22 yards away. It was a reddish brown color. I saw from mid shoulder to top of its head. The color was a reddish brown but a bit darker on the head the hair was also shorter on the head then the shoulders, like a short hair dog, the shoulders were like wiry hair dogs kinda scraggy. Flatter face the head was really long almost like it was a cone or a peak at the top. I was frozen when I saw this creature I couldn't move for like 4 seconds, after that 4 seconds I turned to my friend to see if he also saw it, when I looked back the creature was gone. Sadly he did not see it. But he heard something moving through woods. There was also a very musky smell during this time.",
