  "title": "Night fishermen recall possible encounters near Dillon State Park",
  "date": "1995-03-11",
  "observed": "This is something that happened 19 years ago while a buddy and me were fishing in the backwaters of Dillion Lake State Park in Muskingum County near Zanesville..Some of this was witnessed by 3 people as there are 2 different occasions that we saw & found evidence of Bigfoot..NO JOKE HERE I SWEAR!! First time in the same area we were fishing from the bank and ran into 2 different sets of foot prints that were going along the bank & the river..One set was very small..just like a child's but looked weird..second set was big! My friend has big feet & his boot went into this print we found..We found several prints..The thing is, it was spring and had been cold..No one would have been walking this bank in bare feet! Water was low because it was early spring..They drain water out of this lake in the fall to help prevent spring floods..A couple weeks later we were down at the same place but in my boat just 100 or so yards from where we were bank fishing the day we seen the prints..Anyway we were sitting in the boat and my buddy says \"whats that!?\" and down river at the exact spot that we had seen these prints was a very tall figure standing above the cattails on the edge of the river..very dark figure! BIG!! we were tripping out! This thing slowly stepped backward in where he had came from..The water was higher this day which makes the catfish bite good..This was near evening..I know this may sound funny but very true..Our lantern had quit working and because the fish were biting good we stayed..we had the moon to fish by and it was full that night so we could see pretty good..We stay when the fish are biting! We heard a noise on the bank like something big running toward us..heard a very big splash behind the boat..we were facing down river fishing horizontal to the bank..The boat ROCKED back and forth and we both hit the bottom of the board and hid! I was just waiting for something to bring his hand up on the boat..we were scared..I am fearless! We waited in the bottom of the boat for what seemed like eternity..We cut the anchor ropes and got outta there heading for the boat ramp..loaded that boat quicker than anything! I left my poles on the ramp because we were in such a hurry..We live 25 miles from this area and it was 10 or so years before we went back..This was a place we went every weekend as we are big time fishermen! Never witnessed anything like this ever before and we fish in secluded areas..I would like to show you this area and introduce you to the 2 other people..The other friend only witnessed the 2 sets of prints..I own my own business & am a Freemason..Thank you!",
