  "observed": "I saw a Big Foot when my aunt, cousins and parents were camping at our property.  We had a fire blazing and we kept hearing these strange noises, branches breaking and thumps.   After about an hour of this, I was wondering what might be lurking in the woods.   So I went over to the area where I heard the noises to see what it was;  I went about 10 yards from the fire.  All of a sudden, something about waist high ran very fast in front of me.   To this day I donâ€™t know what it was; I turned and about nine feet away I saw an eight foot creature staring at me.   I did not get any facial details.  I was too far away from the fire.  I could tell that its head had a point on top.  It stared at me for about 10 seconds, but it felt like 10 minutes.  Then it did this slow turn away from me and walked away.  I ran back into the cabin and I did not come out for the rest of the night.  I did not tell anyone right away, because I thought it might have been a trick on me (played by my cousins).   Six months later my parents and I found a 15 inch footprint alongside the pond at our property, when we were fishing near the area of my sighting.  We took pictures of the footprint.   About two years after my sighting my Dad and I were camping out at our land, the same area, and me and my Dad heard a knock.  The next day I found a 20 inch footprint.  I had a camera with me and I took pictures of that footprint.   I have no doubt that there is a Sasquatch that has been living around our property. And I think it might still live there.",
