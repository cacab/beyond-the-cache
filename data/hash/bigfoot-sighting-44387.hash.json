  "date": "2001-07-16",
  "observed": "I was walking in Holy Cross Cemetery looking for graves of veterans. I am building a database of veterans buried at Holy Cross and Lakeview Cemeteries in Escanaba. I was in the back of the cemetery when I noticed, what I thought was a deer. But it did not appear to run away like a deer would do. I continued doing what I was doing but continued to feel I was being watched. I would look in that direction every so often and thought something was there but because of how far I was I could not get a good description. This was in the evening between 6 - 8 pm.",
