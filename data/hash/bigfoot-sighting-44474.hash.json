  "observed": "I was traveling up copper creek near Ashford Washington in my off roader doing a snow run to test out my new knuckle I put in. It was about 4pm and as I was turning a corner, I saw a large hairy biped creature cross in front of me and go up the bank to my right. I stopped and watched for a moment before it had disappeared into the forest. I kept an eye out the rest of the trip, but didn't see anything else. While parked at the top, I heard distinct wood knocks. They sounded less than a mile off, but sound can carry well in the mountains.",
