  "observed": "I had never thought about reporting this until I read about the reports on Mt Graham. Lived in the Gila Valley as a child. Visited Mt Graham as a child with relatives from Michigan. I was 10 years old. I was sitting on a log with a slope behind me. Started feeling \"funny\", like something was watching me. Family called me back to the car, I glanced up behind me and there was something huge and dark partially behind a boulder right up the slope from me. I ran as fast as I could. It was hairy and tall. I hadn't heard anything before the sighting occurred. I told everyone and was told I was seeing things. I have never forgotten that visit to Mt. Graham. As an adult I am still freaked out up there. I know what I saw, it was not a bear! It was large, dark and hairy. I have looked into Bigfoot sightings before, but never connected it with Mt. Graham. I do now!",
