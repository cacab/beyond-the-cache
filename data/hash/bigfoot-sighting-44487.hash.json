  "observed": "Not a good writer, but what happened to me and a friend  - we were walking down an old pulpwood road with his german shepherd  and got a strong smell like a goat and stopped my friend. I walked ahead about 20 ft and said it might be a big rattle snake, about that time I heard leaves rustling and it got louder and a tree about 6 inches around shook back and forth about 2 feet each way and I heard the leaves moving like something was running away. I pulled some branches back and there it was, about 20 feet running away on 2 legs at a very fast pace. It was about 8 feet tall and I could see its muscles in its legs moving and the whitish skin under the 3 inch black hair. Long arms no neck as plain as day. My friend never saw it and didn't believe me. But it changed my life. Would like for someone to call me. Two weeks later in the dentist was an outdoors magazine with the Patterson film in it.",
