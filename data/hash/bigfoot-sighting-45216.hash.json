  "observed": "I am reporting this on-going activity to BFRO on behalf of my sister who lives in rural, south Georgia, in Long County . She and my brother in law just bought a double-wide w/ 3+ acres of wooded and swamp surroundings. I visited her the first weekend she started moving in, and I personally heard and felt a large and Very Heavy Running sound on her front Porch the night I visited. She just told me on the phone, that they are hearing on a regular basis, Screaming and Howling and a Definite Fowl Skunky/Rotten Smell. My nephew has said he has seen Something BIG squatting down in the evening across the property near the Storage Barn. Our Elderly Father lives with her, and Dad heard the screaming/howls this weekend and went out the Back Side Porch, just in time to See What he calls an Adult Sasquatch running across the Fenced pasture. She sent me a Photo last week of a HUGE Prominate Deep Print from her front yard w/a small Print right next to it. I saved This Photo on my phone, I will share it with ya'll. Her new home was empty for over 1.5 years, and I believe there might be a family of squatches living in the swamp and deep woods surrounding her home. Thank You",
