  "observed": "We went down to the creek (Twin Creek in Preble county) to fish and saw a big footprint in a sandbar that was way too big to be human. We took a picture next to my husband's foot which is a size 13. This was found right where the creek starts to turn to the left on a rocky sandbar that depending on the water level is either exposed or under water. The single track was 15\" long x 7\" wide x 5\" at the heel.",
