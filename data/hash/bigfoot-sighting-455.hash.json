  "observed": "In August of 1998, I hiked into the Sky Lake Wilderness to Squaw Lake to fish. Squaw Lake is located in dense alpine forest approx. southeast of the upper end of Fourmile Lake and reached by trail 3 miles from the Fourmile Lake campground. When I reached the lake, mosquitoes were so bad that I made my way to the Lake shore where an on-shore wind kept most of them away from me . At the shore I fished for awhile when the wind briefly changed direction, blowing off shore. As the wind changed I noticed a very foul smell. I remember thinking that there must be something dead in the willow thicket about 10' on the otherside of the trail from where I was standing on the lake shore. This smell was followed shortly by a sound like something hitting a tree with a large rock or branch. This was followed awhile later by what I passed off as a bird, but it was not like a sound made by a bird, more like a high pitched howling. This sound was like the screem recorded in Ohio that the BFRO has on your website and gives me chills every time I replay it. This screem was followed by the tree pounding sound again. By this time I was becoming very unnerved and had an increasingly overwhelming feeling of being watched and I did not want to find out what it was, so I gathered up my courage made my way through the mosquitoes back to the trail,returned to the trail-head and left the area.",
