  "observed": "About two or three years ago I was rabbit hunting using a flashlight. It was about 10pm and I was walking out of the woods, down an old lane. I could hear something following me off to my side in the bushes. At first I thought it was an armadillo or something like that but I could not see anything when I would shine my flashlight in that direction. The movement sounded to be only about ten feet from me. Everytime I would stop, it would stop. Whenever I would shine my light over there I could see nothing. After it followed me for about a hundred and fifty yards I got a little scared and turned the flashlight off and took off running the rest of the way to my truck.",
