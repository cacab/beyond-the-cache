  "observed": "On May 7'th at 1:29 p.m. I received a report of tracks that had been discovered at appx. 10 a.m. the same day. I contacted Richard Myers of Newcomerstown to accompany me to the location. We arrived at appx. 2:30 p.m.and we were told the following account.... \"Well, last night our dogs were acting strange. Several times they headed into the woods barking, then would return back to the house a short time later. This happened several times. Well this morning (May 7'th, 2000) my husband went outside to work on the three strand wire fence he was constructing to place our horses in. As he approached the spot he had quit working on the night before, he noticed that the bottom two of the three wires had been pulled down towards the ground and underneath a fallen tree, which had already had the top cut off. After repairing this problem, he noticed a single print in the soft sandy soil beside a tree on the inside of the fence line, heading down hill. He then walked around and searched for additional prints. Upon arriving at the creek in the valley, on a sandbar, he noticed another track. After examining this print he came up to the house to tell me about the discoveries. He said he might have found the reason the dogs had been acting strange the night before.\" ",
