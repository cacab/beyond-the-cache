  "date": "1993-04-15",
  "observed": "It was early morning, between 8 - 830, I had just left Nixon, driving NW to Seguin on FM 1117.  I had only traveled a few miles on 1117 and knew I was coming up on some very high cat-tails (they had been there for years) on the right side of the road.  As I approached and got within about 50 meters, I saw a huge black, hairy, bipedal creature enter the cat-tails.  I saw the right side of the creature, and I estimate somewhere between 7 & 8 feet tall.  I only saw it for a couple of seconds before it entered the cat-tails, but it could not be mistaken for any other animal, and it was too big to be a person.",
