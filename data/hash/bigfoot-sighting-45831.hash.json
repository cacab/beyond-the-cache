  "date": "2014-07-11",
  "observed": "I was driving home through the mountains, from a concert last night, on Route 8 in Hamilton County, NY and at 12:37 a.m. I hit a \"creature\" that was carrying a deer, with my car. My car is damaged from the hood to the rear by this creature and I know it is at the least injured and its DNA may be on my car. The speed limit was 55 and I was not able to stop in time. When I saw the creature, who was carrying a deer, about to step into the roadway I hit the brakes but was only able to slow down minimally before impact. I did not really believe in Bigfoot before last night and I am still shaken up and have not been able to share this story with anyone. I wanted to stop and see if the creature was okay, but I was scared out of my wits to stop and get out of the car. The creature was huge, at least 7.5 feet tall. I've seen drawings and such of Bigfoot, and this creature looked similar, but had white around his hairline, and his fur was dark brown, almost black. I'm shaking writing this and I am in such disbelief that this happened to me. I can't even report the accident to the police, and I don't know what I will tell my insurance company. My car is totaled, the creature crushed my windshield wipers together, broke many pieces of the passenger side and left smears of dirt and blood all over the rear window.",
