  "observed": "I was going to recover a deer I had shot in archery season. When I found the deer I was getting everything set up to take pictures and I heard this scream that made the hair on my neck stand up. I don't know how to explain it. It was like a scream from a horror movie. It was really close to me then there was some crashing down through the woods and it sounded big. I have never heard anything make that noise before. In the area that it is, borders a huge swamp on one side and is one of the darkest places I have ever been. At night you literally can't see anything with your light off.",
