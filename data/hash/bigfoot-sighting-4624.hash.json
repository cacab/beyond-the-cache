  "observed": "In the early 90's growing up in eastern ky my step-brother and I used to adventure into the hills behind my house on an almost weekly basis, we came across many strange and eerie places in these hills but on this particular winter mid-morning I remember very vividly we were wanting to top the hill which is a very long hike or it was as early teens. Anyway I remember we came along a level area about midway maybe a little more and there was snow on the ground. We came across footprints very large but they stopped after a short distance. These footprints were not those of shoes, just feet. I remember getting scared and we returned home.  IF ONLY I HAD LOOKED UP, I WILL ALWAYS WONDER IF IT WAS ABOVE US IN THE TREES.",
