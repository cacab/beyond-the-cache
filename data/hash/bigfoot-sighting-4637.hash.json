My uncle and his son stayed up all night listening to the strange noise that was somewhere in the meadow. They had no idea of what animal it was, I did. I had heard this noise before. I woke up my mom who didn't want to hear it at all. I bet that the nieghbors across the meadow seen the creature, or at least heard it more clearer than us. This event happened June 26th of 2002.",
