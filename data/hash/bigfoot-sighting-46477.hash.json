  "observed": "There were six of us camping up on the Mt Jupiter Road in between the Dosewallups and the Duckabush rivers on labor day weekend, on saturday morning about 4:00am Ken heard a loud roar, just over the hill and down at the creek bed 500 yards from camp. on Saturday night their were six of us around the camp fire and heard the same roar as from Saturday morning, I told everybody that vocalization is from bigfoot, so we stayed up for a while longer and went to sleep in our tents at about 10:30pm. We heard the vocalizations again at about 11:00 pm Saturday night and this went on for about 45 minutes, then again at about 4:30 am for about 10 minutes. The vocalizations were so powerful that it seemed like they were about a 100 yards away but it was probably 500 yards away but it was loud and clear, then did not hear anything on Sunday night. When I heard the first vocalization the hair on my neck stood up and I got my hunting pistol ready for action, for fear it would come into our camp. The bank is too steep to try to collect foot prints or pursue the creature. I have hunted all over Washington state in the past 30 years and never in my life have I heard a vocalization like that before. When it happened I knew darn well what it was its bigfoot.",
