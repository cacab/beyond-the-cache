  "observed": "On my way to work this evening, at 8:46pm, I was driving down the mountain, when I saw what I thought was a bear, I slowed down, just in case it ran out in front of me, when it stepped over the guardrail, I knew it wasn't a bear. Rolled my window up, it turned, looked at me, had my bright lights on, in two steps crossed the two lane road , then went up the mountain. Scared, omg, can't believe what I saw, still shook up ! Very dark, that animal was dark, matted hair, from what I could see in my headlights. My guess, height wise, close to nine foot. Very tall. Happened on Carl mountain, near Quinwood, West Virginia.",
