  "observed": "I was driving south on Bird Lake Road between the intersections of Tamarack Road and Pratville Road on  September 5, 2014 around 4:30pm.  This is in Hillsdale County in Osseo, Michigan.  I had just crested a small hill when about 200-250 yards in front of me I saw a very large, reddish brown creature on two legs run across the road and into a very thick and wooded area.  This creature literally cleared the road in what appeared to be one huge step.  The sun was shining bright and it's reddish brown hair really stood out.  It appeared to me the thing had been running and maybe slowed down.  As it came out into the opening and saw me it leaped or ran across the road into the heavy thicket.  It was traveling from west to east.  As I approached where it had crossed it had already disappeared into the thick woods and brush.  I didn't look for tracks because I was so taken back by what I had just seen. Up until this time I had never believed in bigfoot or sasquatch.  Whatever I saw that day was no human or any other animal I have ever seen before.  It was very large and probably stood around 7 or 8 feet tall.  It's body mass was proportionate to it's height as well.  I really feel that I saw a sasquatch.",
