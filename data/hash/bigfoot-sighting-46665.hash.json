  "observed": "Around 1:00 am on October 1st, I got up out of bed to get a drink of water and was having trouble falling asleep. As I walked by my kitchen window, I peered out and noticed three pairs of red eyes walking single file about 20 yards up in the woods. I've been a hunter and outdoorsman since I was 6 yrs old and have seen many animals and eyes at night so I wasn't all that surprised. But what really had me perplexed was the height at which the eyes were above ground level. I would estimate that the eyes were hovering around the 7 ft mark at least so that rules out any wildlife that I'm familiar with. The intensity of the glowing red was also unlike anything I have ever experienced or seen before and the creatures appeared to be walking with comfortable balance and agility. It was pitch black and could not make out any silhouettes except a few branches moving. There is 4 miles worth of wilderness behind my house and most of it is government land. I have no idea what I saw that night but am open minded to it being a sasquatch or another creature that I'm unfamiliar with. Have not talked much about it to other people and am afraid people will think I'm losing it but I can't stop thinking about what I saw. Thanks very much!",
