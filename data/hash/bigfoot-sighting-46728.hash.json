  "observed": "I have been hunting a large tract of private land for a little over 3 years now. It is comprised of planted pine hardwood, and cypress swamps. It is bordered on all sides by other large tracts of private land and WMA's that connect to Ocala National Forest.The first encounter occurred in 2012 during archery season, At dusk as I sat in camo in a tree stand at dusk I heard a blood curdling scream in a small swamp close to my stand. Then heavy footprints circled behind me where I could not see. An object came hurdling through the trees and passed above me. Then a few minutes later a stone hit the tree I was in just below me. At that point I stood up and yelled in that direction and made my way back to the truck. Since that time myself and everyone that I have taken hunting in this section of the lease has had some type of encounter. Either the murder scream, knocks, tree breaks, stone throws or a howl. I have had 2 daylight sightings in the swamp. The first was as I was setting up a tree stand. I heard a crash and looked and saw an all black creature peaking from behind a large cypress tree. It was apx. 7 ft tall, thick and muscular. The second was as I went into a stand to put down feed at apx. 11am. I walked up on one either napping or resting in a patch of very thick brush. I watched as it ran in long strides into the swamp out of sight. It was apx.7-8 ft tall, all back, and built more like a NFL linebacker. Lean and muscular. Since that time we refer to them as the \"twins\". I continue to hunt and go there. I feel they know its me and choose to either ignore me or mess with me. I have taken people to this area at night to try to experience what me and my hunting buddies have heard. On all occasions we had good results with either knocks, howls or tree breaks and thrown objects.",
