  "observed": "My wife and me and our two children were coming home from my aunts house between 3 and 4 am. It was very foggy. We were within a couple miles from home when she spotted what she said was a very broad creature that stood on two legs and I became really excited when she said what stuck out to her the most was the figures cone shaped head and the way the hair shined when the lights hit it. I am still angry with myself because I was asleep on the passenger seat. She says the creature had its back to the road and disappeared when we went past it. She franticly explained to me what she saw when we got home and being the Bigfoot enthusiast I am jumped in my car and returned to the spot but didn't see anything.",
