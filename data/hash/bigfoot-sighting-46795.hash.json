  "observed": "I was elk hunting alone and was having a hard time going to sleep so I was just laying in my bag at about 10:30 pm. Initially I heard what sounded like something clearing its throat but it was a very deep sound that was like nothing I've ever heard. 20 minutes later I heard what sounded like a rock land close to my tent and a few seconds later I heard another one land with a thud, neither sounded as if they rolled as the ground was damp from snow melt. Just after 11 pm I heard something come from the tree line behind me \"wooooo\" \"wooooo\" from two separate locations as if there were several and they were talking to each other. Once the sun came up enough for me to see I broke camp and left and didn't look around for sign as I was a bit unnerved by the whole thing.",
