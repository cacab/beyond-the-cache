  "title": "Hunter scouting locations has a possible encounter near Buhl",
  "date": "2014-10-23",
  "observed": "Went hunting south of Buhl about a half mile from the cemetery. In the wildlife refuge I made my way to a large swamp. Seeing nothing I headed back and jumped onto old railroad tracks. I heard something howling in a spruce swamp to the west of me. Every time I stopped it would get quiet. I started walking again and heading north when I noticed something on the road ahead of me about a half mile or so. It was black and at the distance I couldn't make out what it was. The closer I got I assumed it was a bear. But then it stood up and very quickly ran into the ditch and stood in the brush and looked at me. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. Long arms long legs, dark black and about 7-8 ft. tall. It was big and fast. I looked at it and I got the impression it was nervous the way it was acting ... Being a mile from my truck and having 2 of them to the front and back of me and the nervousness I was feeling I decided it was best to head off it was a long walk out.",
