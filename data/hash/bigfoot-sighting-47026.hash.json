  "observed": "I was camping with a friend in the Uwharrie National Forest.  We camped by the first creek bottom on the North section of Dutchmans Trail.  We turned into our hammocks about 7:30pm and soon everything started.  I heard a lot of moving about on the other side of a nearly dry creek bed around 8:00 pm.  The movement was a large animal by the sound of the larger branches breaking.  The animal came across the creek near a spot we had been using as our latrine.  I turned on my headlamp and yelled out \"go on\" thinking bear or something.  The movement stopped but then started closer to the camp so I yelled out again.  Then I got a bit scared when two rocks were smashed together \"bang, bang (pause) then bang bang\" again. This freaked me out a bit so I yelled again.  Then above me on the hillside I heard something being thrown through the woods and landing further down the small valley we were in.  Then the day birds started chirping in an arc across the hill side.  Not long after an owl started hooting quite far away.  Dogs started barking all over the forest and the owl stopped.  Then I heard a wail deeper in the woods and it seemed like after the wail the woods went back to normal.  I have spent a lot of time in the woods but this chain of events that went on from 8:00pm to around 12:00 am has unnerved me a bit.  I knew of these creatures but half believed in them but I have had an experience that has changed how I feel in the woods at night.",
