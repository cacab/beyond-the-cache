  "observed": "It was the middle of the day on a summer day when I pulled into this park that we used to frequent as teenagers, frolicking in the falls. There were only two cars in the parking lot including mine. This park was never known to be crowded. I went and sat on top of a picnic table that was parallel to the start of the winding path toward the falls/creek. I lit a cigarette and was only sitting there for about a minute when I felt this urge to turn around. About six feet from where I sat I saw this Yeti from the waist up only because there was a four foot drop-off where the winding path continued. When I saw it, I turned back around in disbelief then turned around again to confirm that I did see this thing. It's eyes were a gold/yellow, it was covered in brown fur, and in a hunched position. I was so scared I couldn't move. I was frozen in fear! Just at that precise second a bus full of disabled teens with their caretakers were exiting their bus and proceeded to walk on the path a few feet in front of me. I tried to open my mouth and tell them not to go down there, but I was still in shock by what was so close behind me. Once their group had passed me I somehow got up and ran to my car which was only about 100 yards from me. I have never been back to that park since that day.",
