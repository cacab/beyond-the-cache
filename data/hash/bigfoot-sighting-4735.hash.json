  "observed": "In Yellowstone park on road on Mt Washburn.  My Wife, myself, and my two boys observed from our car a large, big chested, very tall (8 foot), dark colored humanoid figure walk up a ridge line some 300 meters away from us.  Can not explain what we saw and for sure it was not a bear.  It strided up the hill on two legs just like any human, it leaned slightly forward as it walked.  July, 2002",
