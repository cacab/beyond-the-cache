  "observed": "It was January 2005 and I was living in Job, WV with my daughter who was five years old at the time. I was renting the house which was a little ways from the road. It was about 3:30pm and I was walking down the long drive way to meet my daughter to get off the school bus. It had been snowing the night before and it was cold out with a few flurries. Well as I got to the end of the drive way the bus came and stopped and I went across the street to get my little girl off the bus and I turned around and at first was talking to my daughter I didn't look straight ahead in front of me but when I looked up I noticed a very large brown figure standing below my porch which was second story and as I walked up holding my daughter's hand it just stood there staring at first I couldn't figure out what it was I have been in WV all my life and had seen many bear, bobcats and even a cougar. So I knew this was not any of these and it was standing at least eight foot tall with man like features it had kind of a flat nose its eyes were shaped like an owls and it blinked several times it didn't move the whole time we were walking to the other side of my porch to go up the steps. In fact we even looked down on it from the upstairs porch. My daughter threw some pebbles down and it still didn't move we didn't stay outside to see when it walked off but I will never forget what I saw I haven't seen anything else like it since.",
