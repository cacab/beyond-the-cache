  "observed": "This is my second reported sighting to you guys.  My first was on Mica Peak near Spokane WA.  This happened two years later 200 miles away. My dad, brother, uncle and I were camped along the Twisp River in Okanogan National Forest towards the end of September.  It was about 10 at night.  My brother, dad and uncle walked upstream about 100 yards to wash dishes in the river.  I stayed at camp sitting by the fire.  The only light was from the stars and the fire.  About 10 minutes went by after they left.  In the fire light I saw the outline of a man walking fast down the road from the direction my dad brother and uncle were.  It walked the road right past our camp and kept going.  It was dark and I just figured it was one of them. Until less than a minute later they came walking down together from the same direction it came from.  There wasn't anybody camped within 5 miles of us in any direction.  So there is my second sighting.  Might be nothing, might be something.  Hard to say because it was so dark.",
