  "observed": "All I am saying is the Bois d'Arc River is real. My dad heard it less than a month ago while hunting fossils near Coffee Mill Lake off of 1396. I grew up in Hunt County, Horton Bottoms. Every ten years, it vocalizes near my mothers house and I have had numerous run ins with it. As of now, it is very active here. Less than a week ago, we met again. To me, it sounds like a human on a bull horn calling cows in for the night, but gosh it's so friggin loud, it vibrates your whole body.",
