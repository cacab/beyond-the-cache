  "observed": "On approximately April 22,14 I was at Fools Hollow Lake near Showlow, AZ I was out on the lake around the bend fishing where a storm was starting to roll in from the east as the storm was getting closer I was becoming more uncomfortable so I decided to start heading in. I was heading west when I spotted what I thought was a bear down on all four drinking water from the edge of the lake my approximate coordinates were 34.277763, -110.071018 and when I first spotted the creature its coordinates were 34.277126, -110.072090 off the point at the bend of the lake (the lake is a sideways \"L\" shape. As I got closer to the creature still thinking it was a large black bear I saw it stand up on its two hind legs and look towards me. The creature then turned and walked into the wooded area behind it where I lost sight of it. The small time frame in which I did see the creature walking depicted very similarly to the Patterson video this creature about 7-8' tall longer arm length reaching towards its mid thigh and walking with a very long stride and a hunch. The creature appeared to have a reddish brown color to it a few shades darker than an orangutan. After losing sight of the creature I was unable to catch it in my sight again. With the storm right behind me and lightning all around I did not want to be on the lake in a 12' aluminum boat so I headed back to shore.",
