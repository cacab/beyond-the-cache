  "observed": "Ok, I seen this thing, and I loved it. The hair stood up on my head. I told the girl at the scale house because it was about a mile from there. She said she would not be surprised at seeing any thing around there. But that has been a few years now but I cant get that guy out of my mind. About 8 feet tall walking with a long stride crossed the road in front of me, about 100 ft. away. I was driving a dump truck so I got a good look but he went right into very heavy brush, a deep place falling to the north, I was going east. He was brown and hairy. I could tell he knew I was there, but he didn't look my way, just minded his own business. Came from the south pretty open field except for trees along fence by road. Thank you. Can't remember year, maybe 2005.",
