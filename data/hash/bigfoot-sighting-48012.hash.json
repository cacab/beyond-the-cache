  "observed": "On or about 00:30 Hours (12:30 AM), February 10, 2015, give or take 30 minutes, I was on my way home from work.  I work in Overland Park, Kansas and live in Lansing, Kansas.  I have been working a special project and my hours are from 3 PM to Midnight.  I was driving North on K-7 Highway just past Leavenworth Road near Falcon Estates Subdivision when a very large animal darted across the road in front of me running on two feet.  I did not slow down and was only able to see the back end of the animal.  The only thing in my mind right now is the fur pattern that I saw.  The fur looked a little longer than my hair which would make the hair about 2 to 3 inches and a little darker than color tan but a lighter color than the color brown, more of a dirty blond, it had waves in the hair, almost curly in areas.  It was larger and faster than any deer that I have ever seen in the area.  The size could be a large horse or elk.  I am glad that I did not hit it because of its size it would have totaled my car.  I cannot be 100% sure but it could have been a Big Foot.  The tail bone was about even to the middle of my driverâ€™s side window.  I drive a Ford Focus.  I was just amazed by the fur color and texture.",
