It was one solid color not carrying any gun or fishing rod. The time was approximately 6:45 a.m.  Back then my dad had doubts about it as we were traveling with my dad, brother and I and at the time my brother and I thought it was a Bigfoot. However, 30 years later my dad swears it was a bigfoot.",
