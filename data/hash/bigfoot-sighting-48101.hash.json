  "observed": "Place: New Preston, CT.,  hillside Lake Waramog, Date: 2/16/15 Saw: Looking over lake from riding in a car on RT.45 the hillside saw a black tall figure just walking along so easily, the figure crossed a driveway from the forest to the other side and continued slouching along swinging arms heading towards powerlines approximately 800 yrds away.  It did not have a hat or any other clothing and snowshoes. The head just sat on the shoulder.  I thought it was a man but then realizing no man could walk on such a steep slope without poles, etc. It lasted a few minutes do to the car moving. The black figure stood out against the white snow and sunlight of day.",
