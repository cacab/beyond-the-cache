  "observed": "My wife and I were driving at about 9:30 p.m. Between Grant Grove and Cherry Gap on highway 180, when we came around a corner and our headlights lit up the straight away and next corner about 100 yards away and at the next corner we saw a large hairy figure walking upright as it stepped onto the road at an angle towards us and it took large strides and crossed the road and went down the embankment. It was very tall with dark hair. I have other observations about the sighting but I was afraid I couldn't get it all done in the aloted time.",
