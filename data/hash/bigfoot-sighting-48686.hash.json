  "observed": "I was driving home from work at nearly midnight. I made my turn and began driving up hill. At the top of the hill, I saw something jump onto the road. It looked at me for a second. I saw its big red eyes, and I could see how big the thing is. I didn't see extreme detail, but it was gigantic. Within a second or two it was in the woods on the other side of the road.  What really made me think it was a Bigfoot, was by how fast it moved, and how high off the ground was its eyes.",
