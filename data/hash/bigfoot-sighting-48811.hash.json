  "date": "2015-09-01",
  "observed": "I saw a white colored bipedal animal, it looked to be around or over 7 feet tall, broad shoulders, and thick coarse hair draping off of the creature. Seen at dusk while riding on a fourwheeler trail to check a soybean field for deer. It looked at me and my brother (for what seemed like minutes but probably seconds, staring us in the eyes) overwhelmed with fear I geared down my fourwheeler. Looking down for a second to realize I was in neutral, as i looked back up trembling with fear he was almost out of sight running through the woods away from our direction. Nobody could have played a joke on us, it is private land and nobody knew we were going back there but the landowner that we told right before we drove back there.",
