There was a lot of trees and tall grass around the lake area All of a sudden I hear a branch being snapped or broken I looked back and there was a large brown hairy \"figure\" With long dropping arms and a smaller figure next to it My friend also heard the sound but did not look back There was a horrible smell and one of them made a really loud scream. Nothing like I have ever heard I was able to see the face of both , their eyes were yellowish And they had very large foreheads and their hair was about 5 inches and very dirty knotty The tall one grunted as it left and the smaller one let out a scream Then they took a really long step and were gone I never went back to that area again I tried to tell my friends dad who was with us and he didn't believe me But I know what I saw and heard ..",
