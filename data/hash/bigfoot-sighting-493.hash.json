  "observed": "In the fall of 1997, I was in the employ of Cannon County Sheriffs Dept. as a detention Officer.One of the dispatchers called back to my work station to tell me of a report she had recieved containing information about a possible bigfoot sighting in the area of Short Mountain. After the callerhung up, we all had a good laugh, thinking the woman to be intoxicated.After reading the report posted on this sight, however, I feel this information could be of use to you. The description she gave matched the one in your posting, especially the incredible speed it displayed when she screamed at the sight of the creature.As this happened quite some time ago, the details are fogged.Sorry I could not be of more use to you.",
