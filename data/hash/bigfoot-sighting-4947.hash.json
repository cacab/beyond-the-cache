  "date": "1992-08-01",
  "observed": "Not much, really, but around 1993 or so I lived  in Yosemite Nat'l Pk. for a few years.  While running accross a talus field in a remote area of the western Clark range, I came across pits in the talus where granite blocks had been lifted up and stacked in neat piles about 3 or 4 feet high.  The rocks were angular, about 2 to 3 feet long, and the biggest of them may have weighed a couple hundred pounds.  The resulting pits in the talus were maybe 5 feet deep.  There was one big pit of that size and 1 or 2 less distinct ones perhaps half as deep.  The area was at least a couple of miles from any trail, or any prominent location that anyone would go to, like a lake or a climbing area.  As I recall, I was basicly running in a straight line, more or less, from the Clark Range to the Mist Trail region. I read Bigfoot books as a kid, and immediately recognzed them as Sasquatch sign, but since I was in a hurry, and not too sure if I belived in him or not, I only spent a few minutes in examination. Bigfoot foraging for rodents?  Quien sabe?  This was definately not trail construction, as it was in a very obscure area without tourist acsess,  but why waste time lifting boulders in the middle of nowhere? As far as my credibility goes,  I grew up in an \"outdoors family.\"  I lived in the park about 5 years and got around quite a bit.  I am literaly an expert climber and outdoorsman with over 30 years afield.  With only minimal bragging, I would put my tracking and mountaineering ability on par with anyones.  I know what I saw, just not what did it.",
