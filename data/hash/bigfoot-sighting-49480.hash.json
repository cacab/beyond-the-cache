  "observed": "My wife and I were camping At Yellowood State Park this past Saturday night. About 1:00am we both were asleep and were woken by a loud hollering noise. It was a very deep howling noise but it wasn't a dog or coyote. The howling noise was very long and very close to our camper. Whatever it was made the howling noise twice and something off in the distance mimicked it both times. There was no barking afterwards and the noise was too loud and too deep to be a human. We both stayed awake for awhile and didn't hear anymore noises.",
