  "observed": "I am a huge bigfooter, and I went on a night investigation right on the border of Lost River in the Methow Valley. My dad and I crossed the river a little after nine and started to go West. We did a few tree knocks and nothing was heard or seen. We decided to backtrack and go East for about half a mile. We kept doing tree knocks and still nothing. I began to feel an incredibly unsettling feeling, sort of like severe anxiety. I belted out a call, specifically a call thought to have come from child sasquatches. Around 7-10 seconds later I heard what sounded like a really heavy rock clunking against a tree. My dad and I became quite excited, so I tried a couple whoops and got nothing. We decided to call it a night and headed home at around ten pmish.",
