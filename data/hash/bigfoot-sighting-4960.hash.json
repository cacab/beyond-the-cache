  "date": "1978-09-30",
  "observed": "A strange creature was sighted at the side of the road in the Fall of 1978. I was taking a friend home about midnight. We both sighted what appeared at first to be a large, standing bear. It did not look like a bear about the face and was about 6 feet tall. We both saw it very plainly and it looked directly at us and did not move. We didn't think anyone would believe us, so we never talked about, except once, about 5 years later. I bought it up to my friend (to see if maybe I just dreamed it or something), but he remembered all the details of the scene as well. I never told anybody else (not even my wife.) It still gives me goose bumps as I type this.",
