  "observed": "On Saturday Sept 5th of 2015, my wife and I were driving north in our RV on route 7 very close to the Vermont state line. It was about 1:00 in the afternoon. My wife saw an animal on the west side of the road. The animal was about 50 yards from the edge of the highway. What caught her attention was that the animal was walking upright. It was very tall ( well over seven feet ). The animal's fur was black. It was most definitely not a bear. We are both mystified as to what this animal could possibly be. W&C Waterbury, CT",
