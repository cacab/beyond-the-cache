  "observed": "In mid August to early September 1998, G.G. and friend reported to me that during this 3 to 4 week time period they were setting animal traps for their fur trade hobby. During this period, usually during the evening hours, these men would hear ear piercing cries in the forest around them. They had no clue what was making the screams, but were very impressed by the volume and intensity of the screams. At some point, the screams were almost musical, kinda like whistling. About a week before the actual sighting in the area they were frequenting, they noticed 3 or 4 very large five toed human like footprints in the soft soil going up the hillside. He estimated the tracks were at least 15 inches long with huge strides even going up the hillside. Finally, on a very quiet afternoon, the men encountered the track maker. They observed it at a distance of about 100 feet. It was covered with medium length brown hair all over its' body except its face. It watched them for a few seconds, then took off up the hillside into the forest away from them. Both men agreed it had a low forehead, small dark eyes, huge hands, bulky body and a nasty smell. After the incident, the men collected the last of there traps and have not returned since. (This report was published in The Monthly Bigfoot Report, October 1998 edition)",
