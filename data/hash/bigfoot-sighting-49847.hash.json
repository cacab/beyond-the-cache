  "observed": "Early Fri. morning, Sept. 18,2015, 3:00AM. My wife and I were camping at Mohican State Park in east central Ohio. We were camping in our van. My wife went to bed at about 10:30PM, I turned in about 1:30AM. I had to leave the van to relieve myself. I opened the van's side door. I have the interior lights set not to come on when the doors are opened. I glanced around outside, as I always do, and stepped out of the van. The center of the road, running through the camping area is about 25 to 30 ft. from where I was standing. On my side of the road there are individual campsites bordering the road, on the other side of the road is the Mohican River. My dying campfire cast a faint glow, the slightly overcast sky provided separation from the skyline and the tree line in the immediate area. Out of the corner of my eyes I detected a slight movement on the road but everything was bathed in shadow from the trees. I felt I was seeing a shadow of something. I leaned forward peering into the darkness for a better look. The shadowed form booted toward the entrance of the camp area. All I could see was its silhouette. It was upright and moving on two feet. It stood at least 8ft high. I watched in disbelief as it covered about 50ft distance with what seemed like 5 or 6 strides and disappeared into the darkness. I did notice that it had a slender appearance. I knew at once it was a Bigfoot. I had heard of other sightings in the area. I stood there, still in disbelief, running through my mind what I had just seen. I questioned everything else it could have been. Nothing else fit. My mind finally told me, \"Robert, you know what you saw. A Bigfoot.\"",
