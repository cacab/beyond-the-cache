  "observed": "9--30-15 we were camping at Virginia Lakes. We had killed a deer and had the carcass out back of camp. during the night about 2 a.m. my son, daughter-in-law and my grandson first heard sounds of rocks or big stones being thrown or dropped. Then they started hearing knocking noises like someone hitting trees with a bat followed by a low growl ending in a high pitched scream. This went on for about 15 min. At this time I was awakened by a a noise. I wasn't sure what it was and I thought a bear was after the deer. I jumped up and my son said something was screaming outside. I ran out with a flash light and could see nothing.  I was looking for a bear or eye shine  I got one single eyeshine about 7 or 8 ft off the ground when I panned back it was gone. I thought maybe a raccoon. But when the family told me what they heard I knew it was not a coon and tried to make them think it was a bear. The next morning when I went to check nothing had been touched but a very large pine tree next to the deer had been pushed nearly completely over. I have been an hunter and outdoors man all my life but have no answer for this. Just thought you would like to know because it happened so recently",
