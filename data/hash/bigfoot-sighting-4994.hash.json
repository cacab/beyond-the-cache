  "observed": "A friend and I were at the back of my family's land playing at the creek. As we were playing I noticed something under a tree that was out in a pasture along a fence line. My friend and myself saw what appeared to be something squatting down. This thing was humane in appearence but was dark in color that looked like fur or long hair. As we watched it suddenly seemed to raise up its arm. At this time we are scared and start to head back to the house. We looked back and then again it raised it's arm then let it fall back to it's side. We ran as fast as we could back to my house. This thing looked just like a huge monkey squatting down.",
