  "observed": "About 5:30 am on Rte 9 heading east in west Brattleboro VT my husband and I saw a small (I don't know what) running across the road. It was about 3 to 4 feet tall, long dark brown to black hair, running on 2 legs. I caught the animal in my headlights very clearly. The one thing we both said was that it was fast. Faster than any animal we have ever seen. It was crossing the road into the swampy area near the small whetstone brook. There were tall reeds there and it disappeared into them. We did not stop. in retrospect, I wish I had. It might have answered some questions we both had.",
