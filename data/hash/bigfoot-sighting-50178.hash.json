  "title": "Recollection of a roadside sighting of a white Bigfoot near Blount Springs",
  "date": "2014-01-14",
  "observed": "I was driving a VW bus so I had a good view of my surroundings. As I rounded the first corner of the exit I noticed what I thought was a big white dog, like an Afghan running on all fours toward the road, up an embankment. We both reached the same point at the same time and I thought I would hit the dog. It seemed it didn't notice my car until it reached the side of the road when it was only feet away from the car. I don't remember slowing much but I wasn't going very fast to start with as the curve was pretty tight. As the creature reached the road and I saw it, it stood up on it's back legs. It was covered with long white hair maybe 8 inches long, it wasn't thick but more stringy and dirty looking and it had a round head, not a dog.  I passed the creature and didn't catch it in my mirrors as it was dark. It scared me.I didn't get much detail of it's face but I did notice a fairly large mouth or lips which were prominent. The head was not huge and the body was pretty slender, it was probably as tall as the VW when it stood up, over 6 feet.",
