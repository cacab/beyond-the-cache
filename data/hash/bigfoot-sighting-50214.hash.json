  "observed": "Hello, My husband was driving home last night on Key Peninsula highway in Pierce county in Washington State. It is a very forested area that does eventually connect with the Olympic rain forest, however, it is also a populated area. He witnessed a 7-8 foot creature, walk from the side of the road into the forest. He stated it was not thin, as thick as a tree trunk, but, what is even more puzzling, is that he has stated that it was a light grey or whitish color and Very Very \"hairy.\"",
