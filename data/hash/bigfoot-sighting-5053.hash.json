  "observed": "My friend and i were going out sign stealing, near Corbett off of I-84, we found a sign that we liked and got out of the car to get it. As we approached the side of the road, near the woods, I heard a low territorial growl. I asked my friend if he had heard it, but he hadn't. We were both kinda freaked out by what I had heard, so we raised out eyes to the darkness of the woods. At the exact second we looked out into the darkness, there came a shriek like nothing we had ever heard before. Then we heard something crashing through the underbrush, and we ran like little girls back to the car. I got the hell out of there, but we are going back this weekend to check it out. We talked about the noise and decided that it was like nothing we had ever heard before. Not human, or animal",
