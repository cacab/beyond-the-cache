  "observed": "January 20th, 2016 about 1100. I was driving towards hwy 126 on High Banks road. I saw a large animal covered in long hair in a field to the right of the road. It was a lot larger than a bear. It was so out of place, in the open field. It was frozen still. I haven't seen any cattle in that field lately. I regret not stopping to take a picture. I was on my way to a doctors appointment and had a car tailing me. I was planning on asking the farmer who owns the property what animals he has had in the field lately.",
