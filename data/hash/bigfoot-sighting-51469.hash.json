  "observed": "I was driving an excavator to the job site in the middle of the night on a brand-new logging road we were constructing when I noticed there were three sets of tracks and they were three different sizes huge, medium, and small! I followed them for a little more than a mile they went all the way to the end where we were our job site was and that's where I lost the tracks. It just so happened to be the only night it rained in August and it was the night of my birthday. After work they were obscured by the rain in the fine dust and lost. My boss saw them as well his nephew.",
