  "date": "2015-11-21",
  "observed": "I live in Craigsville, West Virginia and I've heard stories about bigfoot but never believed them until one morning. I went squirrel hunting and saw one go up a tree. I grabbed a stick and started to hit the tree to see if I can get the squirrel to move out of the tree. I sat there for a few minutes and walked off. I walked away from the tree and heard some knocks off in the distances. I thought it was some thing else so I kept on going. I walked for a few more minutes and I looked back. There was something behind a tree looking at me. It was about eight to nine feet tall. I had no idea what to do, so I ran away.",
