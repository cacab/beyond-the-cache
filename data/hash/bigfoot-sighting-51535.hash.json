  "observed": "Last year 2015 saw this animal two times! Eye shine was very large! Then on March 22, 2016 at around 2:30 AM saw a large (possible) bigfoot! This was upright walking thru my back yard! It was taller than my swing set, wider than my self and saw eye shine! All from my kitchen window! This made me a little scared! Went out trying to find prints but the ground was very hard pack as we had a below freeze at 25 degrees that night! I then called the BRFO to tell about what I had seen!",
