  "date": "1995-10-01",
  "observed": "I was driving my car up a hill at about 60mph when up ahead at the top I saw what I thought was a man carrying a bundle of sticks (about eight feet tall overall) across the road. I reached the spot very quickly and was quite surprised to find nobody there. I actually slowed down to be cautious and decided that nobody could have moved away that quickly, especially someone carrying a heavy load of sticks. I am a person who likes answers and this has bothered me for seven years. It was when I found out about Bigfoot sightings in Ohio that I actually put the incident and Bigfoot together. I must admit that I never believed in Bigfoot, but taking into account all the hair samples and an endorsement by Jane Goodall I must say I think I saw one from a distance of about 200 feet. This is the only logical conclusion I can find.",
