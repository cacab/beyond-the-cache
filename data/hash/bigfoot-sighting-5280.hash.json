  "observed": "I was coming home from a school function around 9:00 in the evening on a thursday, down (edited) street.  Shortly after passing (edited) the car in front of me began to slow down, and I thought they were going to turn, but they did not signal.  They then came to a complete stop and I was slowly coming up behind them.  Something then crossed the road.  At first I thought it was deer, not giving it much thought, but then I realized it was probably a good four feet taller than the mid-size car in front of me.  Another one followed not too far behind the first.  They were very large, barrel chested, like a gorrilla walking like a human.  They sort of marched, lifting their knees higher than a person would when they walked.  They did not seem at all frightened by the running cars with bright lights, they didn't even look towards the cars.  I couldn't see their color or texture because of the darkness, and they were definitely not human. The car in front of me took off quickly, and I drove past a little slower looking out my window, kind of half hoping to see them once again.  I hurried home after that, quite shaken.",
