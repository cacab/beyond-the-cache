  "observed": "I was driving from my grandparents house to my girlfriends house one night in early fall at about 10 pm.  The area I was heading to is up in Tughill plateau which is a very dense wooded area.  I was about 2 miles outside my hometown of Sandy Creek and had about 3 miles of woods to drive through to reach Boyelston, where my girlfriend lived. The road I was traveling on was very narrow with steep banks on both sides.  I had just made a left turn around a corner where the road begins to get steeper and head uphill for about a mile when I saw something beside the road out of the corner of my right eye.  I started to slow down out of instinct because people are always hitting deer around this area when this thing just jumped out into the road in front of me and began to quickly cross to the other side.  I slammed on the brakes and skidded to a stop, which gave me just enough time to see some of it in my headlights as it finished crossing the road and up the bank into the woods and disappeared. I only really saw it from the side and the back so my description isn't really any different from any you may have heard.  It was somewhere between 6 1/2 and 7 feet tall and very strongly built.  Its head seemed to be attached to its shoulders directly because I couldn't see a neck.  But it had very long dark hair, mainly black with patches of brown.  I can't believe I originally thought it was a deer.",
