  "observed": "I heard something funny while running my computer. Out the back window --- I saw a bigfoot looking at me!! --- I said hello (to him?) but he just turned away and went out toward the field. An update from John (12/20/02)--I went around the place and did find a footprint on the bank behind the house. It was pointing toword the house and I took a tape and it was 16\" long with it being 6/7\" wide and on the heel. I could see dermal ridges. (John was encouraged to cast the track. -tp) I also asked the neighbors if thay heard/seen anything. One said they had heard the same weird voices, like a talking, but not making any sense.",
