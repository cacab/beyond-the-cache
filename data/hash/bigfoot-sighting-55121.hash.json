  "observed": "I was driving to Wichita Falls Texas with my family. I was looking out the window and saw this big black figure running fast on two legs. It ran off a hill into a little valley. It was dark black, had long arms, running way too fast for a person, black fur, 7 to 8 feet tall, wide shoulders, had a long neck. I couldn't see its face, but I saw its head and it was kind of oval. I saw it at least 4 to 5 seconds and then it disappeared into the trees.",
