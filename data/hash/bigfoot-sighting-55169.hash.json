  "observed": "On July 3rd, 2016, at around 7AM I was fishing at Norwich Pond in Lyme, CT.  I caught my first fish within minutes of arriving.  When I brought the fish to shore I heard 3 distinct knocks coming from behind and above me. There is a rather steep, high (30 ft?) slope along the access road near the boat ramp. I turned around thinking it was people walking down the road.  Nothing there...  I threw the fish back and recast.  I caught another within a few minutes.  As i brought this one to shore, I heard another 3 distinct knocks from the same spot and again turned around to see if someone was there.  No one! This boat launch/pond is about 4 - 5 miles in from the main road and the only houses around were on the other side of the pond, the opposite direction of the knocks.  I am pretty sure it was an encounter with Sasquatch even though I did not see or smell one.  The knocking was too \"human\" to be an animal and there were NO people around.",
