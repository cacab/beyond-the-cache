  "observed": "On the afternoon of August 17, 1984, about 3 or 4 pm, my (now ex)wife and I were leisurely riding our Vespa motor scooter in the woods on Fairview Mtn. Road, near Yachats on the Central Oregon Coast.  We had been coasting downhill for a minute or two with the engine shut off, so it was very quiet.  We pulled over off the road to look at the nice view of the horizon.  The weather was clear and warm.  Our visibility was excellent. At that point we noticed movement about 100 yards slightly downhill on the far side of the clearcut.  A large brown creature got up off the ground, looked at us, and started walking down the hill along the treeline, looking at us a few more times.  It walked about 20 seconds and maybe 150 feet directly in our view before it stepped up on a 4 foot tall bank, parted the brush and entered the forest.  Along the way, it walked behind and close to a stump, and about 1/3 of its body was visible above the stump from our point of view. The creature walked upright, had a flat face, unlike a bear, a flat chest, and it swung its arms as it walked, very much like humans do.  It was too far away to identify the features of the face, but we could tell the top of the head was covered with hair and there was a mane of heavier hair on it's back and shoulders.  The body was large and bulky.  It did not run, but moved fairly quickly with long strides. When it went into the brush, I said, \"let's go down there!\"  And she said, \"let's get the hell out of here!\"  So we compromised and waited 15 minutes before we went down to take a look. We found the circle where it was napping, round and about 7 feet in diameter.  The dry grass was matted down.  The foot prints away were about 20 inches long and about 7 feet heel to heel.  The ground was too dry to make a detailed print, but the imprint was clearly there, and it indented the ground about an inch to inch and a half.  We did not notice any smell like some people report.  The stump it walked behind was about 6.5 feet tall.  We guessed that accounting for the slope and difference in our elevation from the creature, that it might have been about 8 or 8.5 feet tall, because about 1/3 of its body was above the stump from our view. We were interviewed years later by a man named Todd from the Bigfoot Research Institute in The Dalles, OR, and they published our account.  I have it in storage if you're interested.",
