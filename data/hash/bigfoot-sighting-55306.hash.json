  "observed": "Hi my name is Xxxxx today my 11 year old daughter saw something in our yard. She was looking out the window and saw It walking around. It turned and looked right at her. She said all she could see was hair, black and dark brown all around its face it was like 30 ft away.  It had medium size brown eyes and said no way in the world it was a bear. It saw her, then it turned around and started to fast walk away down the hill on two feet. It went behind a fence in front of our house. The fence is covered with weeds but some spots are open. It was crouched down and peeking at her as it worked its way down  the fence. When it got around the corner it stood up and ran down the hill out of sight. I don't know what she saw but it was as big as me and I'm 6ft 1. She thinks it was a Bigfoot",
