  "observed": "It was the middle of August & about lunch time. A friend of mine & I was heading south of Union town & decided to go to Ft. Scott for lunch. So we cut across on a gravel road. I was reading a Big Nickle (advertisment paper) and we were talking & going along when my friend suddenly seemed to quit talking in mid sentence. I looked up and saw somehting running upright manlike all hairy, about 5 feet tall but it was going so fast it was to the trees & gone by the time my eyes had focused. My friend (who was driving) says \"did you see that?\". I said was it about 5 feet tall & reddish haired. He said \"it looked at me\". I said what was it, you saw it better than me, I just looked up. He wouldn't say it but it was a Bigfoot. It ran very quickly across the road. Otherwise I would have always thought it might be a prank but it ran way faster than I could. It was about 1 block ahead of us when it crossed the road. It was on the east side of a creek & we were just coming to a low water bridge. It was very windy that day. As we drove past the place it went into the woods I looked but saw nothing more and I could see 3-400 yards up a grade to a ridge. As it ran across a small group of birds flew up out of the ditch as it ran into the woods.",

Going north out of Crawford County the hiway jogs over on Highway 39 (I think) and goes north, from there go 3 miles north (there is an old red church buldind on the NW corner, go about 1 & 3/4 miles to the low water bridge & about 100 yards past the bridge is where it crossed. It was going south."
