  "observed": "On two separate mornings while deer hunting in a fairly remote section of Washington County, before sunrise, and after tree breaks and knocks at close range, something screamed/whooped at me. I am a Vermont native, grew up hunting, camping, fishing, and generally emersed in the outdoors, and while I am familiar with subject of bigfoot,..I have never experienced anything like this before or since. The conditions on both mornings were clear, cold, and extremely quiet. I had hiked into to where i was going to hunt, leaving my vehicle around 5:00 am, getting to where i wanted to sit around 5:45 am, and after changing into dry underlayers had shut my light off and settled in to wait for first light. Activity began both mornings only minutes after dousing my light. This occurred in November of last fall, 2015.",

  "location_details": "White pine ridges with hardwoods in between forming a bowl. An old beaver pond which has since turned to meadow in the center about 200 yards x 100 yards with an active and multi-leveled beaver pond adjoining. No houses, no roads, and as many times as i've been up there I've not once come across another person. Moose and black bear sign abound..."
