  "observed": "My boyfriend is a hunter and a trapper. He traps trouble beaver for the county. This was about mid-Aug. He was out checking his traps out on the Chaney Lake Rd., south of Wakefield MI. He was heading south, came around the corner, saw something all black in the middle of the road. Being a bear hunter also, he hurried to see if it was a bear. It stood up on 2 legs looked at my boyfriend, took 2 steps to the west and was into the swamp. It passed in front of a curve sign, going into a swamp, that was 9-10 ft tall and only 6 inches of the sign showed above its head!! It was very black with long arms. So he got down there and it was gone. No path, no broken branches, no noise, nothing.  Now he won't go in woods without a gun. And this is a man that used to bait bear with only a 10 inch knife!!!! And releases wolves, that get caught in his coyote traps!!!  He's seen hundreds of bears and has tracked them in the dark. He said this was NO bear. And he's still rattled about it. We think it was a Bigfoot.",
