  "observed": "I lived in Las Animas county, Colorado, with my mother and step-father in a canyon called San Miguel which is located along the Raton Range on the Colorado/New Mexico border.  We lived in a very remote area.  (Behind Fisher's Peak near Trinidad, CO)  I used to have to get up real early to get to school.  It was daybreak and our dog was outside barking hysterically.  I had never heard her growl or act this way before or after this morning.  She was looking into the canyon.  I went to our kitchen window which faced the canyon.  I could see something running into the canyon.  It was on two legs, tall and covered in hair.  It didn't run like a man, it ran as if it was straddling a small rut, side to side.  I ran down the hall to my parents room to wake them up so they could see what I was seeing.  When they got to the window it was gone; however, I saw it one last time as it passed between bushes.",
