  "observed": "While on vacation, we were on our way to watch the sunset.  My daughter pointed out her window and said \"look! What is that?!\"  My son sat to her left and I to her right. All three of us looked out the window to see what appeared to be an 8-10 foot tall hairy being. It was standing slightly turned so we were looking at its left shoulder & back. It was very hairy and we could definitely make out a head and shoulders. All three of us had a definite clear, unobstructed visual for 7-10 seconds. It was light brown to tan in color.  About 45 minutes later we were on our way back and it was gone.",
