  "observed": "It was opening day of modern gun deer season in Logan County Kentucky, Nov. 14, 2015.  My husband  took me to my deer stand at the edge of the hay field.  There was no moon, and I couldn't see much of anything in front of me. I waited until he left in the old Jeep and continued to wait for approximately 10-15 min before I turned on the red bill light on my cap to load my gun.  I loaded three shells into my 243 then turned off my bill light. Within a minute I hear a rustle on the ground to my left and slowly turned my head in the direction of the sound.  I saw two red lights, like eyes approximately 30ft away and I judged the red lights to be 8-10 feet off the ground.  I thought for a second that I was seeing spots before my eyes from my red bill light.  I rubbed my eyes and blinked a couple of times, thinking I needed to clear my eyes.  The lights were steady for a few seconds then blinked twice, like I had done.  I was wondering what was going on, thinking another hunter had walked up to my stand, then I heard loud movement in the leaves as if it was moving up to the old road approximately 50 yds away. I could not make out a shape but as it neared what I considered close to the  old road, it stopped and started a low whoo sound that increased to a very loud whoop.  I was scared then, I have hunted for many years and I have never heard an animal make that sound. I clicked the safety off my gun but by that time I could hear it making it's way along the old road ridge heading toward our cattle barn.",
