  "observed": "I have hiked the Appalachian Trail Georgia to Hanover NH ( 2006-Present ), I am a section hiker. While staying at The Tom Leonard Selter,East Mtn State Park Mass.I  had an incident. While solo camping at the shelter I decided to call a big foot in. Or try, it was a erie evening, i went to get water it was a long way down. While I had a feeling something was watching me. It was getting dark...uneventfully I hiked back. I made a big fire that lasted for three hours, made alot of noise. Did a couple Bigfoot calls. A whoop whoop type. A wood knock ( no return ). A local plane saw my smoke and buzzed right over my camp site. After a great meal, some singing, i went to bed on the TOP bunk. I always sleep with one eye and ear open. At 2:30am I heard a solid Wood Knock followed immediatley by a tree gettintg pushed over. It did not crash . It sounded dead and not tall... \" Wood Knock then a Thud \", after that nothing. 1/2 hour later I was back to sleep.",
