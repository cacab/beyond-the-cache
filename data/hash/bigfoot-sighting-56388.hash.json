  "observed": "I was on my way home from town between 10:30 and 11:00 pm. As I was coming around the gravel road I received a message on my phone. As I opened my phone to check my message I seen a creature walking upright across the road. It stood about 6 to 6 and a half ft tall. I quickly started backing out of my messages trying to access my camera on my phone. At the time I first seen it, I was about 50 yards from it. By time I came to a stop I was within 25 to 30 yards from the creature. When I first seen it, the creature was in the middle of the road in the process of walking straight across the road. It wasn't In a hurry, it calmly walked across the road and stopped about 5 ft. off the road still in sight. I was able to take a picture of it before it walked off into the woods. From the moment I seen it, it never took its eyes off me. I tried to switch my camera over to video but it was too late. It was gone. I was fortunate enough to take the picture I got before it was gone. That is definitely a night I will never forget.",
