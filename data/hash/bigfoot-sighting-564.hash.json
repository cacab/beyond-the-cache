  "title": "Witness observes sasquatch run along treeline",
  "date": "1996-05-01",
  "observed": "I observed a form walking in an upright position for a period of about 5 to 6 seconds. The figure was darkish-brown in color and it appeared to be very large in size.  I had just walked out to bring my dog in and it had started to sprinkle. As I took her off her leash, I looked up across the golf course and saw a form move out of the edge of the trees and run across a space of about 20 yards until it disappered into the tree-line. When I saw it, the Patterson/Gimlin footage came to mind, and I was left to belive I saw Bigfoot. The figure was about 200 or more yards from me and it was very hard to make out what it was.  I have never seen this creature again. That is probably due to a new golf course was built a year or so later and there was, and still is, a lot of construction going on there. I never thought to look for tracks until the next week. We had got some rain and if there were tracks, they were washed away.",
