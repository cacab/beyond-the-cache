  "title": "Early morning commuter swerves to miss tall hairy figure near Grain Valley",
  "date": "2014-03-05",
  "observed": "I was driving to work very early in the morning, since I had to drive from Grain Valley, MO to Olathe, KS to work. I use the back roads to avoid the freeways.   I came around a curve and a very large creature/person was walking in the road.  As I came around the curb, I slowed down to pass this \"person\" and thought, \"Good Lord this is a big person.\"  The creature/person was so tall, That the hands and lower arm were at my passenger side car window.  (I drove a Nissan Cube.)  Since I had slowed down and moved over, I looked back and this creature/person, had crossed the road behind me and was already over a 4 foot fence and moving quickly through the field on the drivers side. The creature/person was very dark in color, even when my lights hit him.  He was all hairy and I thought goodness, that coat is over kill, until I realized it was not a coat, but a hairy creature/person. I think he was walking along the road, because he wouldn't suspect anyone to be on this road at 4:30-4:45 in the morning.  It was still very dark out and the road is pretty much without street lights.",
