  "observed": "We were cooking a hog mid day on a smoker and across the road in a big field about 300 yards away, there was a huge hairy creature standing beside a white oak and looking at us. I grabbed my phone and took a picture and then it disappeared. After it was gone. Myself and my father in law walked up to examine the area. There were tracks and judging by a mark on the tree and looking at the photograph. This creature was estimated 8 feet tall. The owner of the property says he sees it all the time.",
