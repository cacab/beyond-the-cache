  "observed": "My father-in-law hit and killed a creature 30 years ago in his car. He called DR they took it away.  He has never heard anything back from it.  6-7 ft tall covered in hair walking on 2 legs like a man.  This is the interesting thing... snout like a bear or hog long fangs!! 30 people gathered around to see it.  I don't think it was a bigfoot but it was something weird like a werewolf.   I have seen big foots on our property,  wood knocks so loud it scared me to death. Terrible smells like I can't explain and foot prints in fields.  Small monkey like creatures in trees.   I am not on drugs... I know I have seen these things. I wish yall could investigate our area.  We have 80 acres.",
