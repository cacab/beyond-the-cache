  "title": "Visitor to a ranch has evening sighting near Priest River",
  "date": "2015-12-26",
  "observed": "I was in rural Idaho, just north of a small town called Priest River. My friend and I go up to his ranch every year or so and just live there for a month. He has a dog that we bring along and like every other dog, he has the occasional need to relieve himself. So it was nighttime and it was my turn to take the dog out so I picked up an old Ruger 10-22 and brought the dog out for him to urinate. I was waiting outside when I saw a dark figure just beyond the tree line. It was massive, easily twice my height, and it just stood there, watching me. I would have taken a shot with my rifle but a tiny .22lr round wouldn't do anything to a creature that size. I just stood there looking back at it, when suddenly it broke out into a stride along the length of the tree line and it silently disappeared into the night. I was frozen in place until the dog tugged on the leash, beckoning me inside. I quickly gathered myself and rushed in through the door. I never saw clearly what was lurking in the darkness but I'm sure that it was Bigfoot.",
