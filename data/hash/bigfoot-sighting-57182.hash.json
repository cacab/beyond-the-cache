  "observed": "Hiked in several miles north from the white Pass ski area. It began to snow. I was hunting elk with a muzzleloader. I jumped what I thought was a group of elk from a dense cedar seep thicket. Continuing north up a small canyon as it began to snow more  heavily. I heard what sounded like chimpanzees huffing. I've been a hunter in these mountains my whole life and have never heard anything like this in the woods. It became clear to me that there were 3 separate individuals communicating with each othe back and forth. Two on the left side of the canyon, which was my side and another on the right side. I tried to catch a glimpse of whatever was making the chimp huffing and chattering but was unable to see anything. The storm became worse and it was getting later in the day. I would say I was a little afraid and decided to return to my camp. The next year I returned to this exact spot and had a rock the size of a grape fruit come down thru the tops of the trees. It landed about8 feet from me. I beat a haste retreat.",
