  "observed": "Was about 11pm and had stopped in the middle of the road to go to the bathroom.  Nova Road is 30 miles long in cattle country.  After 20 seconds of being out of my car, my sister said someone was coming.  After she said that I heard branches breaking to the side of the road where the woods are.  I glanced to where the sound was coming from and saw a tall dark animal running toward my car.  The animal had to be 7-8 feet tall. After I saw the thing running from the woods on the side of the road, I ran back into my car.  I was scared.  When I first saw it, the thing was running from the woods towards me and my car.  I'm like, we're outta here.   It ran like a man, upright, It was 11pm, so naturally the color was dark in appearance.  But from my taillights, I'd still say it was dark in color.  And it moved fairly quickly.  Which is why I jumped back into my car so quick.  As I sped away, I tapped my brake lights and saw the thing standing in the road looking at us as we drove away from it.  It was a really creepy feeling!. I still remember it clearly to this day.  It was so errie.",
