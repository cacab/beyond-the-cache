  "observed": "I don't know if this is of interest, but way back in 1970 while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail north of  Hoodoo ski area, something happened that I will never forget.  I was with three friends on a hiking trip.  When it was time to hit the sack, around 11 pm, we all got into a small wall tent.  All of us were in sleeping bags, ready to go to sleep.  Then we heard heavy footsteps.  They sounded like a man walking.  Who or whatever circled our tent three times, brushing up against  the tent without tripping over the ropes holding up the sides of the tent.  It was very dark  outside. We saw no light  from a flashlight.  We thought \"How can a guy walk around the tent without a light\"?  By the way, I do not think there was anyone camped within miles of us.  Needless to say, this scared the heck out of us.  We did not get out of the tent to look around- too scared.  We were all only 15 years old at the time!  That's it.. Not much there, but it is all true.  Again, I will never forget it!",
