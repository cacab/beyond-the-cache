  "observed": "In 1971, I lived in Portland, Oregon.  While out one evening, in the woods around Boring, Oregon, I was driving when a large upright animal ? ran up onto the road, from the right, ran away from me, down the road approximately 30-40 ft., then up the small embankment to the left and out of site.  Me and my companion jumped from the car, but couldn't see anything else.  It was about 40-50 ft. ahead of us when it ran up on the road. It stood approximately 6 ft.  The body was covered with hair but it ran flat footed.  It paused to look in our direction when it first entered the road, then turned and ran.  It was dark, so what we observed was all caught by the head lights of our car.  We really couldn't make out a face or much else, but there was no doubt it was not just a man.  The arms were in proportion, not long and dangly.",
