  "observed": "I feel stupid doing this but my teacher told us in class the other day about his bigfoot experiences. I don't want to attempt to tell the whole story but you people should really talk to him. I respect him alot and he told us that he has encountered a \"creature\" at least 6 times in his life time in or near the vicinity of a bridge called the \"1893 bridge\" in Cooke County, Texas. It's located north east of Callisburg on Survey Road. He told us that they have seen it in the light of their headlights. He said it stood at least 8 maybe 9 foot tall and that it could step over a fenceline. On one occasion he told us the creature was bouncing a limb up and down with its arms one night in the light of their headlights and they measured the height of the limb the next day and he said he couldn't even reach the limb. On several occasions there was more than one person in the vehicle with him. Several times he had people go with him during the day time to look for tracks and stuff and he said that they found bones in the bottom of this creek where they had seen the creature during the night time. He claims that his buddies have taken shots at the creature  but it never had any effect (he didnt know if they hit it). I hope this can be of some use to you. This is all second hand but it is from a well respected man of the community who doesn't lie.I can find out exact details if you would like me too.",
