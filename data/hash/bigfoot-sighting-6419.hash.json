  "observed": "My husband, my brother-in-law, and I were riding down towards the Miss. river about 8:30 p.m. that night. We were in a car, my husband was driving and I was sitting in the middle, my brother-in-law sitting beside the passanger door. As we were going down Hwy.88 I saw a creature that was about 7 foot tall,and weighed about 245 lb. It was completly but lightly covered with dark brown (black) long hair. As we were riding and our car lights hit it, I saw it on the right side of the road. It stood there for a moment observing the oncoming car. I stared at it, and it stared back at me for a brief moment. As I was looking at its eyes, I noticed a reddish tint. His features reminded me of a cross between ape and man. It was standing upright on two feet. And like a human it ran across the road. The speed with which it ran across, was unlike any I have ever known. I asked my brother-in-law if he had seen it? He said he saw something cross the road, but it was so fast he thought it was maybe a deer. He couldn't say for sure what it was, because he was carring on a conversation with my husband. Still to this day I will not go down there after dark. ( February 11, 2000 )",
