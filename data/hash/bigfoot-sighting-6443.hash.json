  "observed": "I was driving my car home from my  girlfriend's house. So I took this one road, because it was a faster way home for me at the time. The road  is hilly and nobody lives on this road. Just an old house which no one has lived in years. The time of  night was just before midnight. I remember this time  because I had to be home at midnight. So I got on  this road from Goolinghorn Rd. and started on down  it. When you get on the road it starts to go downhill  at a good pace. I was going down the hill for about  1/4 of a mile and I remember seeing what looked like a deer. It was brown, real hairy and was on all  fours. Thinking that it was a deer, a pretty good  size deer. So I slowed down thinking I was going to get a look at a deer, which in my town is pretty common. Well I got about a hundred yards from this thing when it stood up on two feet and took off running in the woods. I will tell you it scared the daylights out of me. I remember watching this, I guess I can say Bigfoot, running into the darkness and I looked back at the road and there was some roadkill in the middle of the road. Well I took off right after it took off and did not look back. It did not make any sounds. It was real quiet even when it ran in the woods. But there was a real foul smell, but that might have been the roadkill. ",
