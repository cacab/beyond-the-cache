  "observed": "My brother and I were out riding our mini bike one afternoon after school approximately 4:00 to 5:00 P.M.. It was the beginning of Spring and we were searching for bait to go fishing.  We parked our bike on the road, which at the time was gravel and traveled very little. We walked down a path that was used by a farmer to get to his pasture were he had cattle grazing. As we walked down the path I felt as though we were being watched. It was an eerie feeling that still haunts me to this day as I recall the incident. Off to my left and approximately 30 to 40 yards away, and 50 or so yards from the main road, was a hairy creature standing in a bent over slump raking it's arms through a patch of May apple. My brother saw it at about the same time. At that moment the two of us ran as fast as we could not looking at each other, but looking at the creature over our shoulders. I was afraid that it would come after us, but it stood in the patch of May apple looking at us as though it didn't know what to make of us. I have told this story many times since that day. Many people laugh in disbelief, but I know what I saw and it could only be one of two things. Either someone dressed in a Bigfoot costume, or it was Bigfoot himself.",
