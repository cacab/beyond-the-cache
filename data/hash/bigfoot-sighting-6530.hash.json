  "observed": "This happened some time ago and I have never told anyone this before. I was around 7 years old when this happened. I was at home and had just finished lunch when I went outside to go and play in the woods behind my house. Our house sits on the edge of some pretty dense woods. I was by myself and had just climbed down in a ditch that drained into Beaver Creek. As I climbed out of the ditch onto the otherside I was just looking around when I noticed something looking at me. It was standing in a bamboo thicket,motionless. I remember the wind was blowing around and I noticed the fur blowing around on its head. It had no expression,it made no noise. I was paralyzed with fear and couldnt move. It had to be on two feet because the bamboo we were in was way over my head. From going over this over and over in my head it was around 5-6 feet tall. But the main thing I remember was the stare. I didnt want to run because I did not know if it was going to charge like a dog or what. I slowly backed down into the ditch and climbed backwards up the other side. I was not going to turn my back on it. When I reached the edge of the woods I ran. I recall the color was a reddish brown. I dont know if it was older kids messing with me,but it sure seemed real to me.",
