  "observed": "Hello, I was talking to my wife, who lived in Mexico City at the time, by cell phone. This happened about a year and a half ago. I drove from my house about 2 miles up the road. I live on farm land so the neighbors are far away from each other. I got to a hill where the road goes left and right. I stopped the car and had the motor turned off. Right before I hung up I heard a yell coming from the woods that were to my right. I told my wife, who is a vetenarian what I heard. She laughed a little and we said good bye. Before I turned the key I heard it again but it was getting really close. Im talking about 200 feet.I did not want to find out what was there so I turned around and came home. I got on the internet that day and found a site that describes different animal sounds. A coyote, a donkey and a bear. The next sound was that of a bigfoot. It matched perfectly. I live about 20 miles south southeast of a town called Seguin. I went back listening the next day and several times after that. I have not heard it again and  I really dont care to. Mikey",
