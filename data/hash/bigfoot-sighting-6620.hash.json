  "observed": "In July of 2001 I was driving up State Route 170 from Calcutta, Ohio. I passed through a small town called Fredericktown and continued north on State Route 170. About a mile or so up the road I noticed a very tall, hair covered creature walk across State Route 170 from east to west.  I was less than 100 yards away when I initially saw it and by the time I got up to where it crossed all I could see was the backside of the creature cresting a hill out of sight. This was nothing that I have ever seen before. It walked in big strides unlike any animal known to me. To me, it was a Bigfoot. ",
