  "observed": "I was walking north on highway 96, on the riverside of the road, approximately 3/4 of a kilometer south of the Somes Bar store. I saw something out of the corner of my eye, and when I looked across the road, I saw what appeared to be a big, hairy, extremely tall man. I froze, and we stared at each other for what seemed like many minutes, but was probably only 30 seconds or so. When I realized that whatever I’d seen wasn't going to harm me, I turned away for a few seconds (to see how close I was to my cousin's driveway), and when I looked back, it was gone. The brush that the creature was standing in was at least two meters tall, and the creature protruded above the brush from the upper chest up, so I would estimate it's height at three meters, or maybe just a bit more. The creature looked a lot like the Bigfoot in the movie called \"Harry and the Henderson’s.\"",
