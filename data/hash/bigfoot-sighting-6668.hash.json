  "observed": "My girlfriend and I were staying at her parent's house near Marlborough, New Hampshire.  I am writing on her behalf because of my access to the internet.  I also have an interest in bigfoot related stories and lore and so am familiar with this website.  However, I have not had any experiences or encounters myself. This particular night, my girlfriend was startled by an unusual howling scream while watching t.v. at approximately 11:45 p.m. (her father and I were asleep and did not hear anything).  The howling scream seemed to eminate from across the street in an area that is heavily wooded.  At the first scream she thought that she must have heared an injured person's cry.  There were approximately four screams (although she is unsure about this), each about 5 seconds apart.  After hearing the second scream she went to the front door (about 10' from her) and stood outside on the stoop where she heard the last two screams. She estimated the distance to the screams as approximately 400 feet, to the other side of the street where there is a solitary house.  I believe, however, that the screams may have been much farther away.  She says that they were 'very loud' and stationary, i.e. they didn't sound louder or fainter with each progressive one.  She also notes that they sounded as if from around the corner of the house, not a clear shot from her to the point of origin.  In other words, she doesn't beleive that the 'animal' could have seen her at the front door. The next day she described what she heard to me and I immediately thought of the recordings from your site.  Her description sounded alike.  After returning from our trip I played the recordings to her (over the phone) and she says, \"identical,\" specifically the 1978 recording from Snohomish County, Washington.",
