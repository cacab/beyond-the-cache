  "date": "2003-07-26",
  "observed": "Just sitting on the patio with my husband talking and I looked out toward the woods behind our home and in the blink of an eye a tall black creature walking on two legs took 2 large steps past our shelter and barn and was gone.  I didn't say a thing to my husband. I was not believing what I just saw.  From where I was sitting the creature was as tall as our bugwacker. I only saw the side view of it.  It never turned its body or head, it just took 2 large steps and was gone.",
