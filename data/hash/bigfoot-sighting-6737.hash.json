  "observed": "My family and myself were in Colorado on vacation. We we going down the Phantom Canyon between Florence and Canon City Colorado. We were probably 5 miles into the canyon when we made a curve in the road and I noticed out the right side of the car several cows standing around and a large black furry thing, kind of bent a little in the knees walking around the cows. He looked maybe 7 to 8 foot tall. He was swinging his arms really fast like he was trying to get away in a hurry.I never saw his face he had his back to me. I was shocked at first and could not really say anything but about 5 minutes later I told my Dad and he turned around and went back to the place where I had saw him. There was nothing there by then except the cows. We drove back a couple of miles and some people were camping but they were packing up to leave. My Mom and Dad did not believe me for a long time, but a few years after that they had went back and had heard that someone else had seen such a thing around Colorado and that something had tried to get into someones house not far from there and had found some fur on their back screen door. This was back in 1985. Noone had ever really believed me but on 8-7-03 I watched a special on Discovery Travel and they had some reachers on there trying to track a Bigfoot sighting in Oklahoma, so I looked up your web page when I got to work today.",
