  "observed": "I was sleeping in my big rig with the engine off and my alarm was set for 4:15 a.m. Somthing woke me up five minutes before I was supposed to get up. I got out of the truck to have a look around and saw nothing. I then got back into the truck when I heard a sound that made my skin crawl. It was a loud high pitched whooping sound that echoed throughout the forest. I have never heard anything like this before. About a year later me and my son were watching the Discovery  chanel or The Learning Chanel about Bigfoot and they had what was supposedly the sound from a Bigfoot. It was the very same sound. And again it made my skin crawl and the hair on my neck stand up. My son thought it was very funny that his dad was standing on the couch like a scared old lady when we heard it. WAYNE HEARRELL",
