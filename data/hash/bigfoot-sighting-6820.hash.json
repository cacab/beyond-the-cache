  "observed": "I was 16 years old and I worked for my uncle on a farm by Chandlerville, IL. It was mid-December. We just got done feeding cattle. We decided to take a break and go target practicing behind the farm. We were standing by the creek shooting targets on the ice. I looked down and saw a footprint in the ice. It was big. The creek was approximately 6ft wide and ankle deep unfroze. I told my uncle and he said \"Yeah its a weird looking track, it looks like a foot.\"  It had five toes. It was twice the size of a normal human's foot. On the other side of the creek there was a heel print on the other side where the water met the bank. Then there was no others prints, that was what was weird about it. This area has big hills and alot of timber that goes on for miles. In my opinion I think this was the tracks of a big foot.",
