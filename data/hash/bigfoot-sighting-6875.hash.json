  "observed": "I was a frequent visitor to my grandparents since I was born in 1985. When i was 8, on a walk down to the baseball diamond one night, i heard a stirring in the woods. Figuring it to be maybe a hunter (I was ignorant of hunting seasons at the time- so I could not rule that out), I turned around to head towards the woody hillside along the driveway to greet the hunter, or to threaten him off the property (my grandfather allowed certain people to hunt deer when in season) from a safe distance. however, instead of seeing a person with reflective gear, I saw a large, tall shadowy figure with odd eyes- its eyes glowed red, probably from a reflection or something... it slowly backed away though, and headed up the hillside. Scared, i ran back to my grandparents home and told my folks i saw something- (they told me it was a fox, but i know from wat i saw that is impossible) They all laughed it off. But on the way going back down the driveway, my folks stopped because one dropped something in the car. while our car was temporarily not moving, I curiously looked out the window and over toward the hillside, and i could make out the shadow and the eyes. I was 8 at the time, but I was rather intelligent for a kid- I knew what a deer looked like, what a fox looked like. Since that time in 1993, Ive heard sounds and reports of similar activity. Ive also noticed the occasional long shadowy figures and eyes, but from a safer distance (and from my car!) and long after i started to get used to the things.",
