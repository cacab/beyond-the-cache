  "observed": "A powerful \"roaring scream\" was heard by Dana and Sharmayne while they were fishing on a dock approximately 150 meters west of the Hoover Campground (located along the south side of Detroit Lake where the Santiam River empties into the lake).  The scream emanated from a point along the lake to the west of where the witnesses were fishing. Approximately 30 - 40 seconds later, an unidentified fisherman was seen running away from where the scream had originated.  Upon seeing him, the witnesses immediately joined the visibly panicked fisherman on the trail and the three of them continued running until they reached the relative safety of the campground. Once there, they ladies asked, \"Did you hear that scream?\"  The shaken fisherman replied, \"Hear it?  Whatever that thing is was right next to me!\" After their brief conversation, Dana and Sharmayne quickly struck their camp and drove back to Portland.",
