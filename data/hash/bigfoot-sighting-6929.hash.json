  "date": "1981-07-07",
  "observed": "We were camping at the Golden Fork Hot Springs with 2 other groups of people. It was around 10:00p.m. or so and after talking to each other at the camp fire we all went to bed. After finding I could not sleep, I decided to take a walk. It was a beautiful moonlit night in the summer of 1981 I could not sleep so I got up to walk down the small dirt road since it was a bright beautiful night. I had on an old style red & white striped full body suit & put on my white/tan rabbit fur coat. I was walking down the dirt road when about 200 yards from the camp out from the right of the road a large 7 or 8 foot(Mabie Taller.)grey bigfoot came out about 10-15 feet in front of me . He turned to face me & we looked at each other straight in the eye. The bigfoot looked just as surprised to see me as I was to see him. It was like we were both walking at the same pace and just appeared to each other . Well, I'll tell you we both turned around from where we had came and I ran like heck, sliding back into my sleeping bag and kept watching, hoping he would not come to camp. Needless to say he did not appear again . I did not tell my friends the next morning of my experience in fear they would think I was crazy. ",
