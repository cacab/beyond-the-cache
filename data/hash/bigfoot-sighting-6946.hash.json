  "observed": "I am a fifty four year old man living in San Francisco. I have never had any interest in this subject until this week.  An old friend of mine moved to Gold Beach, Oregon, and I was driving up to see him.  I had never been on Hwy. 101 before, and became nervous driving on the two lane winding roads.  I kept pulling over to let cars in back of me pass. At about 20 miles or so before Crescent City, I pulled off to allow cars to go by, as I went to pull back onto Hwy. 101, I heard the most horrifying scream that I had ever heard.  I screamed myself and ducked down on my seat, looking up next to my Honda CRV, was a filthy looking gorilla (best as I can describe) it instantly ran into the tree line a few feet away, and vanished into the dense brush. I saw it for maybe 3 or 4 seconds at a three quarter profile.  I would say it was 6.6 ft to 7 ft high, with a wedged head, and it had very dirty matted dark brown dull hair.  Strangely enough, seeing the thing didnâ€™t frighten me, but the scream it gave out only a few feet from my open window almost gave me a heart attack. I never heard a noise like that, and I never want to hear it again.",
