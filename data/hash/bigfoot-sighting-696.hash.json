  "observed": "This was on an Elk hunting trip. My friend and I was going to meet one of our party at a point on a road, in the early evening. While walking along the logging road we came up on these huge tracks in the road. They were on the road, and off the road, into the trees then back onto the road, like it was wandering. And also there were more than one size tracks. Some were smaller than the others.. The farther we walked, the more tracks we found. By the time we met our friend, we thought we wouldn't say anything and see what he would say about the tracks. He said, well I didn't see any Elk, but these tracks are all over the place. We headed back to camp and the next day we headed home. There is no doubt in my mind,that these tracks were made by a mighty big creature. The tracks were about 18 inches long and eight inches wide on the big ones and maybe 15 inches on the smaller ones. They had to be very heavy to crush the hard snow, down to the road bed,like it did.",
