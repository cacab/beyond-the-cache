  "title": "Early morning vocalizations heard near Rainbow Creek",
  "date": "1968-10-16",
  "observed": "It was about 4am and I was home laying in bed. I heard some dogs barking, which was not unusual since coon hunters were common. I heard something making a screaming noise, unlike anything I have ever heard. The dogs were evidently chasing whatever was making that noise. I was very terrified by the sound the animal made and did not look out the window. I heard heavy thudding footsteps pass my window and what must have been at least two or more dogs following and barking.I was terrified for several nights after.I did mention it to my mother. I was watching a television program ( many years later ) on the Discovery Channel about Bigfoot. Someone had made a recording of a bigfoot. When I heard that recording I was terrified and recognized it as the same creature I heard nearly 20 years before.I will not listen to the recording again, as it frightens me. Recently, 2003, my mother got up after midnight to get a drink of water and heard some type of animal making a screaming noise outside. She said she did not know what it was. When she told me about it, I told her that she did not want to know what it was. I am reluctant to give this report as I do not want ridicule. I have not heard the animal since, and I hope I never do. I have never seen any strange animal,however at the time people were reporting seeing what they called a very large bear.",
