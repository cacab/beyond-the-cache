  "observed": "I was heading to my home in So. Calif after vacationing in the Bella Coola region of British Columbia. It was getting late around 11:00 PM so I decided to pitch my tent just for the night off a Forest Service Rd. heading south from State Highway 410. I was wide awake reading a magazine inside my tent when I heard a distinct animal vocalization essentially identical to the recordings on the BFRO website listed as the Puyallup and Snohomish recordings. The call consisted of a 20 to 30 second duration \"shriek/howl\" and multiple \"bark/grunts\" of short duration lasting about 90 seconds. My Golden Retriever was sound asleep for most of the vocalization but woke up for the last 15 seconds and immediately bacame alert peering out into the darkness. I was surprised at his reaction due to the fact I could barely hear the grunts near the end of the incident and I thought my dog was pretty hard of hearing as he is 11 years old.",
