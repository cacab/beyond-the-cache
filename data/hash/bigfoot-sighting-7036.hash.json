  "observed": "I'm not sure even how to tell the events as they unfolded. All I know is that a large something followed me from a place I was sitting half way back to camp. At first I thought it was a back bear until I came to a large open field on top of the mountain. I had walked out of the heavy timber on a trail to an open field (the moon was very bright almost like daylight in the field , it was very easy to see my surroundings). I walked to the middle of the field, sat and waited, and nothing happened. So I continued on, reaching the heavy timber on the other side of the field on the trail. I turned and looked back and noticed a large black bump sitting where I waited just moments ago. Then it stood up and walked right at me. Then I said “Hey you” in a loud voice. Then it turned and it walked or ran very fast directly to the north into the timber. No noise, but it looked to be like a bear due to the heavy coat. But when do bears walk like humans? And it had a large swinging motion on the torso area. Very weird. So I'm afraid really to tell this story because I do not want my friends or family to know about this. It's such a weird thing to tell people.",
