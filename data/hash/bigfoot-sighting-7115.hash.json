  "title": "Mountain runner spots large, deep footprints on Stuart Fork Trail in Trinity Alps",
  "date": "2003-10-14",
  "observed": "Was hiking/running the Stuart Fork trail (Trinity Alps)yesterday, and came upon about a dozen footprints right where the trail enters Morris Meadows. The trail gets very heavy use (tho didnt see anyone yesterday) so the prints are most likely a prank or maybe superimposed boot prints, but they interested me enough to make this report (i personally dont believe in bigfoot). They werent very clear, but each print was about 15\" long and the they were a good 4+ feet apart. They were much deeper than surrounding boot prints, which is what caught my attention. I took a few photos; ill send you a copy when they get developed.",

  "location_details": "right on trail, where trail first breaks into open meadow--about 50 ft or so of prints; the trail surface becomes too hard to sustain prints before and after the tracks, so i couldnt follow them very far."
