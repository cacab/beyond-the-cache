  "observed": "Well, me blake and richie were camping out back in the woods.  When we heard a terrible moan. Then we heard it moan again, and we heard it begin to run towards us on two feet.  We jumped back from the fire and turned on the lights on the truck. As the lights shined down the hollow that night, I saw something I hope to never see again.  It was around 6 feet tall, long arms, and dark hair covered its body.  We were about 20 yards from it.  I looked at it for about 10 more seconds before we jumped in the truck and drove off as fast as we could.  I can assure you that this is no hoax.  Promise to God.",
