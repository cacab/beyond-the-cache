  "observed": "I myself have had many different occasions with the creature I have dubbed \"Fang\". I have come to understand through self experiences that there is more than one creature in our area.  I go hiking quite often in the same area and know exactly where they usually are, as they tend to follow me most of the times I am there.  My mother told me today about your web site and I felt obliged to write. I fear of people coming to our area and trying to find Fang and his clan. I feel somewhat of an understanding and a protective closeness, and I feel they should be left alone. Anyone who has had the wonderful experience of seeing one with their own eyes knows the truth. The world would only want to capture and destroy them if given the chance I fear. I would be willing to talk to someone about my experiences, but I do not really want to tell everyone, due to my beliefs.  My children have heard their cries out in the woods, and we have gotten rather close enough for their smell many times.  Just last week my younger son and I found footprints in the woods by a thicket too dense for us to walk into.",
