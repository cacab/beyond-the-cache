  "observed": "When I was about 8 or 10 yrs old, I saw a Bigfoot. It was on Green mountain near Huntsville, Ala. It was unpopulated then. Now there are million dollar homes there. I was on my way home from my uncle's house on a gravel road. I was on one side of a hill. The road went down this hollow and back up the other side. In the ditch line was Bigfoot, about 8 ft. tall with arms that looked like they reached down past his knees. It was slightly leaned foward looking straight at me. It scared the daylights out of me. So I went back to my uncle's house and told him. He got his shot gun and we went back. It was still there looking at us. Uncle threw up the gun to shoot and I told him we needed to get closer. So we went down the hill and as we did we lost sight.  When we got back up the other side it was gone. ",
