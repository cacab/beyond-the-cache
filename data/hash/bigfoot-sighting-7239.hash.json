  "observed": "My friends and I were going for a walk and we came across a bare footprint. It wouldn't have seemed odd, but it was in the melting snow and it was the only one we could see. We ran to my parents and told them what we found and we brought a tape measure and took a polaroid picture of it. It only measured 13-14 inches long which is not very long at all but it did seem wide. I don't know how significant this information is but you never know. It was a long time ago anywhere from 10-15 years ago...I guessed on the year, I think I was anywhere from 8-10 years old.",
