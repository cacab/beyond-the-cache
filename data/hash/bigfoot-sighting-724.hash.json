  "observed": "It happened about 10 or 12 years ago. Myself, nephew and an elderly family friend Terry, were in this swampy wooded area fishing. They were in a small boat, no motor just paddles. As they were fishing they heard something walking in the woods. They looked to see what it was because it seemed to loud for a deer. They saw something walking up right covered with gray hair. The lower part of the animal was blocked by bushes, but they saw all they wanted to see and said it stood about 7 to 8 feet tall. The creature was 70 to 80 ft. from the witnesses. The creature had very large eyes.",
