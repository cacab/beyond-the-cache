  "observed": "It was probably April sometime, right before the time change. I was 15 and waiting for my bus in the wee morning. I noticed it was really foggy and the sun had barely risen at this time. I lived in Plainview a small conglomerate of houses southeast of Sisters. Anyway, I first noticed the bus coming towards me from about 3/4 a mile away. By the time it was a 1/4 a mile away a black figure of pretty good size popped out from behind the moving bus. It appeared as if it was hiding in the ditch. I don't know why it made the decision to suddenly pop out after the bus, but it did. It seemingly was in a run to get to the forest. We lived less than a mile from the national forest boundary. It ran through a small, vague valley that was in front of me. Sagebrush and the odd rock was in this little valley. The figure I saw was entirely black. It could have been for the lack of light. I also must note that this thing was running fast. If it was a man they must have been running like crazy which is not easy through the maze of sagebrush. I couldn't see any detail which limits my conclusion on this experience. But what I do know is that I never witnessed joggers or sprint runners ever in my neighborhood. And where this being ran there was no trail, no path it was following. It was barren property. Why would a runner be doing this at 6am in the morning in the middle of sagebrush and rocks? Doesn't make sense! My story ends as my bus approached the figure went out of view behind some houses as it neared the ponderosa trees.",
