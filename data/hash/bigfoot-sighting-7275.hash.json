  "observed": "We live in Ottawa County. Got 10 acreas here. When we first moved in I took my son out back. Well I found some unusal tracks. I could smell something that the smell almost made me sick. I could hear grunting somewhere in the woods. I thought if I told anyone no one would belive me. I was so scared I told my son come on lets get out of here. This happened back in 1994. To this day I have not been out back on my property. My son and I saw the tracks. They were big, not of a human. I live in a town called Nunica in Ottawa County. We have a lot of swamp like in the woods and a lot of woods. The only thing is I did not see anything. Just heard grunting. I thought it was deer and seeing the tracks.",
