  "observed": "Heard what I thought was music and low voices coming from low hills on each side of creek. One low voice or sound on one side, then another on the opposide side of creek. I was cooking diiner with my small optimus stove and had camp set. Sound was so strange that picked up camp and hiked down the the moonlit trail. (All the time I felt I was hearing limps and sticks break above me on ridge line. I was in the middle of my thru hike of the Pacific Crest Trail and had been outhiking since April 2nd. I have never heard these sounds in all my hiking or hunting days past or present. In the morning, I stopped at a side creek to fill my water bottles. I walked above the trail for a deeper pool to dip bottles in and found where something had crossed and slid vegation going down and then up. Next to creek was a large footprint in small sand bar. The other prints were not as clea, but I wish I would have taken there pics as well. I haven't told many folks about the sounds or print till the last few years. Good luck with your research. I feel that at least in 1977, Bigfoot was still alive and well. (I believe there were two comunicating across the creek. Tracks were found in Eagle Creek Bench area which has since suffered a few good burns.",
