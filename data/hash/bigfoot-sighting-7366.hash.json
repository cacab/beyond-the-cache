  "observed": "My girlfriend and I were driving westbound on Hwy 58 just west of the summit.  When I saw this very large, seemed to be dark in color, come running across the road at a very fast speed!!!  I was very tired and thought that maybe it was a large elk or something.  So I looked over at my girlfried and she was in shock, she could'nt believe what she saw.  She was very certain that it was on two legs.  So this is what I saw just to let you know i am not the type of person that would just write something like this if it was not 100% true.  I just would like to report what I saw and try and help you guys out.  thanks.",
