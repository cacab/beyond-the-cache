  "title": "Large Hairy Arm Knocks in Window Screen",
  "date": "1977-05-15",
  "observed": "One night, while lying in bed reading a book, the screen from my window came flying in and landed in the middle of my bedroom floor. As I turned to see what had happened, I saw a large hairy arm reaching in. This all happened fast, so there was very little time to analyze what I had seen, and I just sat in bed, scared to even move. I was around 13 at the time of the incident, the room was long and narrow...roughly 10'L x 20'W, and the window was between me and the door out, so I would have to get across the room and out going past the open window...this took a couple of minutes, as I had to get up the courage to even get out of the bed. Finally, I ran out of the room and told my dad, who was half asleep and half watching TV in the living room, which was on the other end of the house...2 rooms away from mine, seperated by about 30-40'. Naturally he was a little skeptical...until he saw my screen laying on the floor...then we went out to see if we could see anyone...nobody or nothing around. Having two brothers and living in the country, I was used to seeing weird things happen so I wasn't too easy to scare...but this was a little beyond what was weird, and my room was soon rearranged so that my bed was on the same side of the room as the door, and I kept the window closed for quite some time after that.",
