  "observed": "I am writing this for a friend who doesn't have internet access.  Last summer, he was driving towards Oroville.  He had just passed a place called Robinson Mill and came around a corner when right in front of him at about 100ft, something was crossing the road.  It was walking on two legs and was covered in a medium brown hair from head to toe.  One thing noticed was it's height; about 5 ft tall.  It's build was long and thin for it's height.  The hair hanging from its arms seemed to be long.  It was very fast as it ran. At first sighting, the being was walking across the road at leisurely pace but upon sensing my friend's approach, broke into what he described as a very hurried and incredibly fast pace.  He said that it literally leapt into the brush alongside the road at a dead run.  It never looked in the direction of my friend's approach.  It was right in the mid day's sun and was a medium dark brown.  It may have been a younger one or something because it seems in most sightings they are very tall. Beginning of sighting was about a 100ft distance.  Distance was 35 to 40 ft at the last part of sighting.  He saw it leap into the Manzinita brush from only about 40 ft away!!",
