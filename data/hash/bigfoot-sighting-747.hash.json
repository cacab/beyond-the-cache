  "observed": "The first incident happened in the Fall of 1998. The witnesses were sleeping, around 10 PM, when they were awakened by 2 loud vocalizations. The first was more of a loud growl, the second started low and progressed to higher pitches and sounded like a scream. The witnesses related that it sounded as if what ever made the sounds was standing in the room with them, it was so loud. They said you could feel it. The husband got up to investigate but found nothing. He said that his 2 dogs were very scared, they would not move from where they were laying in the house. The husband stated that \" I couldn't have pryed them off the floor with a spatula.\" The second incident occured in October of 1999. The wife let their dogs out that morning. The dog involved did not return as she usually does, so the wife went out to look for her. At the bottom of the front steps she found the dog bleeding from the stomach area. The wife took the mixed breed dog to the vet. The vet stated that the dog had been hit by something big, such as a car or something. The witnesses said that this dog never went to the street, which was approx. 200 yards from the house. The dog weighed approx. 25 pounds. The injuries included massive internal injuries and a 1 1/2 inch cut on her stomach.The vet said it was a puncture wound of some sort and also the dog's rib was broken. Unfortunetly, the dog died. The witness believes that the dog walked up on a Bigfoot and was kicked by the creature. The cut on her stomach could have been where it's toenail had cut her.",
