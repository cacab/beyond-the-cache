  "title": "Children have sighting near Alder Lake",
  "date": "1981-05-31",
  "observed": "We decided to take a walk upstream, where the creek was narrow and rounded a bend away from camp. We got about 1/4 mile from camp and noticed rustling sounds in the bushes directly across the creek from us, maybe 40-50 feet away. We kept walking upstream, pausing a few times to listen, each time still hearing the rustling. As we kept walking and trying to see what was making the sounds, we realized whatever it was, was keeping pace with us across the creek. Then we noticed a face peering through an opening in the bushes. It was mostly covered in reddish-brown shaggy hair. The eyes were a golden brown color. The sun was dappled through the branches over head, but light enough to really see it looking back at us. We kept walking another 100 yards or so, with the sasquatch peeking through the bushes maybe 2 more times. ABout then we all looked at each other and remembered that the creek ended upstream in a swampy area and we would be face to face with it if we kept going. Also the realization that we were being paced by a huge seemingly sentient creature panicked us, and we ran back to camp, fast. We told our parents, who took us pretty seriously. I remember reading about other sightings in the area that same weekend, whne we got home from camping. We didn't see or hear anything else that weekend, but we were too scared to go far from camp after that.",
