  "observed": "It was on a warm summer night in 1978, as I was watching television at about 11 pm, that my father and I heard some loud, high-pitched screams coming from the forest behind our house.  The screams only went on for a minute or so, but what surprised me was that my father, who has lived in Stevenson his entire life and knows the woods and the local animals well, did not have any idea what was making that sound.  I was 17 at the time, but just recently, my teen age daughter, who has an interest in such matters, played me the 1978 Snohomish County recording of Bigfoot calls, and I have to admit I got a chill from hearing it, because it was, to my recollection, just what I heard on that summer night in August of '78.  She urged me to file a report with the BFRO, even though it's \"ancient history\" by now.  My father and I did go out on the porch and look around a bit upon hearing the screams, but did not leave the area of the house in the darkness.",
