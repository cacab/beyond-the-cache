I was on a dirt road on the yakima river near the richland washington delta.I was getting ready to leave so I turned on my lights and all of a sudden I saw 2 creatures standing upright looking towards me. I immediatly took off verry scared it was behind me.I remember it was covered in brown hair and one was about a foot smaller than the other one. Bothe thier faces were covered in brown hair.They seamed to be frightened when I turned on my lights.I also recently found some tracks up on chinook pass in the snow about 3miles near bumping lake . I will continue looking for evidece I have some property in the blue mountains near dayton washington Ive follwed tracks manny times and last summer had a bigfoot shake my 30ft fifthwheel with me my wife and my 2kids during the late hours of the night.
