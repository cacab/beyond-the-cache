  "observed": "Last year when I was 12  I saw a Creature. It was about 9:45 pm. It all started when I was taking my dog outback to go to the bathroom. When I got outside I felt like I was being watched but ignored the feeling untill the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I became very nervous when my dog stood still, looked away from the house, and growled. We lived on nine acres in a rural mountain setting near a river and at first I thought it might be a cougar or a bear in the dark. Then I shined the flashlight in the direction the dog was staring, and I saw two large hairy animals go over the fence. The larger one was about seven and a half feet tall and was a female.  She just stepped over the five foot tall barbed wire and wood post fence like an athelete.  The smaller animal was about five and a half feet tall and it used a fence post to help it leap over the fence. They both had yellow eyes. Like a cat. Their hair color ranged from a very dark to a  light brown. They both had an ape like head. Then I ran back inside with my dog and told my mom and dad that I saw two Bigfoots. At first I was really scared. Then my parents went after it,not to hurt it but to see it up close. I wanted to go but they woudn't let me.(BUMMER!) When they got back they told me what they saw and what happend. My dad said when he shone the flashlight on the momma he said she just stood there an stared at him. My mom said once she and dad passed the gate toward the acerage she smelt a wet-dog,musty smell.The wierd thing is that the smaller bigfoot was nowhere in sight..The momma bigfoot must have hidden the younger bigfoot either behind her or by the river.My mom said she kept hearing noises behind her.The next day me,mom,and my dad saw huge tracks in the grass.",
