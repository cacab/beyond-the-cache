  "observed": "I was hunting arrowheads on some land that has a large lake on it. I was not really supposed to be there but I was just looking. I had been there about 4 hours and was leaving when I got on the lake shore I noticed about 300 yards away something in the water on the other shoreline. At first I thought it was just a stump but then it got up and moved. It was a good distance away but I know it was no bear. It never noticed me and keep soaking in the water. As i climbed up the dam to leave it must have seen me because it got up and walked to shore. I didn't see it as I finished crossing the dam to leave.",
