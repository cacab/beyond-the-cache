  "date": "2004-01-01",
  "observed": "My Daughter and I were enroute to Spruce Knob which is in Pendelton County WV. While traveling up a very long dirt road(we were about 6 miles off of the main road at an elavation of approximately 3500 feet) we observed very large footprints in the snow. My husband wears a size 12 shoe and these were larger than that. The foot prints looked like a barefoot human foot. The 2nd toe was longer than the others. The footprints went up the mountain and crossed a fence. We did not attempt to follow them.",

  "location_details": "I'm sorry but I do not have a map at the moment so I'll do my best to explain where we were. We left Green Bank, WV heading toward Seneca Rocks. I think that it is Rt.55. We took a dirt road which ran west off of the main road. It was marked 17miles to Spruce Knob. We only made it about 6 miles up that road and had to turn around because the road became snow covered and icey as we got higher. I would guess that we were about 3500 ft because it seems that we almost reached the top of the mountain and were just traveling around the ridge. There was a mountain spring where we stopped and got water close to where we saw the footprints."
