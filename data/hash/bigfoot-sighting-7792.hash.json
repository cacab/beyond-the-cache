  "date": "1998-01-31",
  "observed": "One night in 1998 my husband (then boyfriend) his friend and I were riding in the woods near our house.  It was hunting season and so we were going shining a.k.a. spotlighting for deer.  It didn't work so well with three people inside the cab of the truck, so I decided I'd sit in the back and hold the light and both of them could look out of the side windows.  Anyway, we rounded one curve on nice graded dirt road and I shined the field near it.  At the edge of the woods was what appeared to be a bear, but it had red eyes.  This thing, whatever it was, was huge!  I'm no genius but I'd say it stood as tall as 6'5\" possibly 7'.  It never ran towards us or anything, but I wasn't sure what it was capable of so I climbed quickly into the cab through the sliding back window.  My husband's friend saw it also, as it was on the same side as him...to this day we don't know what it was.  I don't think it was a bear though.  I've never seen a bear in this area that damn big!",
