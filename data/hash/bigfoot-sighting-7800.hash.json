  "observed": "I have some friends that live in Lovells, which is located in Crawford County.  In the summer of 2000 I was visiting my friends. I arrived at their house at approximately 6-7pm and no one was home. It was during mid-summer so I got out of my vehicle and sat outside.  Their residence is in a secluded area.  While I was outside I heard many noises, like something was moving around in the woods and \"heavy\" grunts. I dismissed it as coyotes or maybe a bear, but I got back in my vehicle feeling a little unnerved and left. I returned later when they were home and told them about what happened.  They laughed at me and told me it was the \"Bigfoot\" that lives in the area.  Although they dismissed me with humor they had told me that they had prior experiences with something, but they weren't sure what it was.  Their location is a densely wooded area.",
