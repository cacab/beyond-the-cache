  "observed": "I grew up camping in the Central portion of the Adirondack Mountains.  Indian/Lewey Lake area to be exact.  With that said I have been going there for 25+ years and am very familiar with all of the sights and sounds.  My incident happened a few years ago in the spring of 1999.  I was camping the last weekend of May with one of my dogs on the south side of Lewey lake.  I think there were maybe a total of 5 camps being used.  One of the nights around 10pm I heard a loud and very unfamiliar cry/scream come from the north side of the lake.  I sat there in silence with my dog, almost in shock because I had never heard anything like this before.  It went on with a series of screams for about 10 seconds.  It was not a bear, not a moose, etc.  It made me a bit uneasy as I could not place the sound.  It was not from any campers either as there were only a handful and were all on the same side of the lake as myself.  I just went to this website today and listened to some of the sound clips available of 'BigFoot'.  The sound I heard almost exactly matches these clips.",
