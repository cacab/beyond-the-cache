  "observed": " We were driving home to the Lancaster, Ohio area on Lithopolis Road heading in a southeastern direction.  We were coming over the hill just before the intersection of Lithopolis and Rock Mill Road slowing down to 30mph because of the very dangerous intersection. As we approached the intersection about 100 feet from the covered bridge, my friend said that he sees a set of eyes reflecting from the car lights on the left-hand side of the road. We quickly slowed down to take a look at what he was looking at. We all looked in the direction and witnessed a tall dark figure with yellowish green eyes walk from the left side of Lithopolis Road into the wood line at a normal pace taking very large strides. Being so late at night, we came to the conclusion that it could not have been a person because of the lack of homes in the area and it being late at night. We all agreed that the object in question was way to built in stature to be a person. The limbs appeared to be more elongated than a person. At no time did the object in question go down on all fours like a bear.",
