  "observed": "After reading report 7804, I suspect that my son may have seen a bigfoot in early December, 2003.  His mother and I are divorced and where she lives outside of Grass Valley. There are houses out there that are close together but also big areas of wooded lots. He told me that he thought he had seen Bigfoot while walking home from his bus stop. Normally, my ex-wife picks my son up at the bus stop, but he had asked to walk home this day.  It is about 1/2 mile from the bus stop to his house.  As he was cutting across the woods, about 100 feet from the bus stop and 20 feet off the pavement, he jumped up onto a stump.  Below him he saw a black figure, taller than 5'10\" (my height).  It was about 15 feet from him and breathing very heavily.  It had its arms to its side and was rocking slowly, side to side.  My son was afraid, but didn't want to scream in case the animal reacted badly to the noise.  He just slowly backed up the hill, keeping his eyes on the creature and when he got to the pavement, ran home.  He said the creature turned its head to follow his movements, but otherwise didn't move. When my son got home, he immediately told his mother and then later, me.  Neither of us believed it at first, but after seeing report 7804, which was in the same area, I thought I should submit the incident.",
