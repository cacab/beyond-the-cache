  "observed": "when we toped a small hill and started down the other side, i saw a large hairy thing walking by the corn that was not taking up. I stopped the car in the road,( on this road you might see a car, one in 30 minutes), and said whats that. My wife, sitting on passenger side, looked and saw it to, my oldest son was in the back seat, but to small to remember. this thing( I call it that because no one acts like they believe) was walking to the right a couple of steps, turned and took 3 steps to the left, turned and walked back the way we first saw it, it was taller than the corn stalks, hairy, dark brown or black, it was swinging it arms as it walk and slightly leaning fowards, ( the film of the bigfoot they show on t.v. is the same, but I dont remember it looking at us). we watched it until it walked into the trees by the creek. We turned right in the small road that goes to her parents house. we stopped on the other side of the trees with the creek in the middle and did not see it again. we went to the house and told her parents. We ask ourselve`s even today why we did not go and look for it or tracks. I think my father in law and i where going deer hunting?",
