  "observed": "On February 15th, 2004 at approximately 9:30 PM in Petersburgh, NY a resident on a rural road noticed his dog chained outside was extremely agitated. He stepped out on his front porch, when he heard several shrieking screams. They were continuous in nature. He stepped in and asked his wife who was watching television to step out and she too heard it scream. The witnesses have lived in Alaska and the male witness is an avid hunter. He has never heard anything of this nature in his life before and described the vocalization as \"un-Godly\" and the loudest thing he'd ever heard before. The next morning, he observed a set of footprints in the snow coming from across the road, up a steep embankment and across the field to the west of the house in a northwardly direction. The strides were described as 5 - 6 feet apart. Note the field was covered with approximately 14 inches of snow. The witnesses' son tracked the foot prints into the forest behind the house where apparently a second set of footprints joined the original set. Witnesses have lived at the present location for the past twelve years and this is the first time anything of this nature was encountered.",
