  "observed": "First, my friend Mike and I, along with two girls, were at the city park and heard it from bellow from the hill behind us. Three days later we went back again and this time I saw it. I thought it was a tall pole but it looked to be wavering in the breeze that was blowing. I called Mike over to look but it wasn't there. Then it caught my eye. We saw it walking up the hill where we had heard it earlier. My second sighting was at our family farm, three miles away from the first sighting. I and my friend Bill rode out to the farm that evening to check on things since nobody lived in the house there. As we turned into the driveway the headlights swung, and there it stood, stepping over a 5 strand barb wire fence. It had its hands on the top wire and was swinging its leg over. Its eyes glowed in the light like an animals. We left in a hurry.",
