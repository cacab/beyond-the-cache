  "observed": "My wife (now-ex) and I were camping at Iron Creek campground, mid summer, and decided to go for a drive.  The exact area cannot be remembered at this time, but it was a couple hours before dark approx 6:30-7:00 P.M., and we were traveling down a dirt road, that inclined and turned slightly to the left, and there was a branch (logging) road that dropped slightly down and to the right as the main road went left.  As we were traveling about 25 MPH, i glanced down the side road, and about 75 feet down the logging road, in the middle of that road was an erect standing creature, approximately 6.5 to 7 feet tall.  Dark brown, almost black.  I did not slow or stop, mostly because I was only armed with a .380 cal auto, and driving a compact mazda 626.  Not too much of a defensive position to take.  It was clear outside, comfortable 70-75 degrees, and no rain for days prior.  As we went further, we couldn't really understand what was seen.  And by the time we processed what we saw, we decided to just keep moving.",
