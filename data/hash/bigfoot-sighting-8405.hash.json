  "observed": "THE DATE WAS 1963, I WAS 17 YEARS OLD AND HAD JUST GOT MY DRIVERS LICENSE. I WAS ON VACATION ON JEKYLL ISLAND GEORGIA. AT THAT TIME IS WAS NOT VERY BUILT UP AT ALL. IT WAS 4TH OF JULY EVENING JUST AFTER DUSK. I WAS WITH MY 10 YEAR OLD BROTHER, AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOING TO THE NORTH END OF THE ISLAND TO OBSERVE THE FIRE WORKS DISPLAY. HOW EVER I REALLY JUST WANTED TO DO ALLOT OF DRIVING AROUND. I HAD TURNED OFF THE MAIN ROAD, ONE WHICH CIRCLED THE PERIMETER OF THE ISLAND, ON TO A DIRT ROAD. IT WAS RATHER NARROW AND WINDING. AS I CAME AROUND A TURN I SAW A CREATURE STEP OUT OF THE WOODS ON TO THE ROAD. IT STOPPED, AS THE LIGHTS FROM MY CAR SHOWN ON IT. IT WAS ABOUT 5 1/2 FEET TALL. IT WAS COVERED WITH LONG HAIR FROM HEAD TO TOE. THE HAIR COLOR ALMOST SEEMED GRAYISH. IT STOPPED FOR A MOMENT THEN JUST PROCEEDED TO CROSS THE ROAD AND GO INTO THE WOODS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. NO ONE REALLY BELIEVED THE STORY, BUT MY BROTHER DOES RECALL BEING FRIGHTENED THAT EVENING, BUT NOTHING MORE. I NEVER THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT IT UNTIL A SAW A SHOW ON BIG FOOT THAT MENTIONED SIGHTINGS IN THAT AREA.",
