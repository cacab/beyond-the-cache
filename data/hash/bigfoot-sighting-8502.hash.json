  "date": "2004-06-16",
  "observed": "I was driving my car near my house. The road curves a bit, then you go up a small hill, and as I as coming down the small hill near the RR crossing I saw a HUGE, 7-8 foot, 300-400lb, creature walking with its back to me on my side of the road. It was silvery white/grey with dark grey roots and grey patches. It had very broad shoulders and almost no neck. I dont think its head was pointed. It was almost leisurely walking down the road. I was so scared, I didnt know whether to stop, honk, or turn around, so i kept driving. As i got closer I started to scream in terror, The closer I got the louder and more terrified my screams became. I remember seeing a cowlick on its back. At the intersection of K and 170th (road I was on) I stopped for a minute, hyperventilating and full of adrenaline. I wanted to turn a car over or serioulsy hurt something. I was so scared, and angry (must have been the adrenaline). I didn't dare look in my rearview, because if I saw its face, I would have had a heart attack.",
