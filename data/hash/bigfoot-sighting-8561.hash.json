  "observed": "Hello, I just found ur web site, have 2 reports. NO B.S.                   This occured in North Port, Florida in 1999, in the summer. My wife & i were sleeping & about 2am we both woke up and heard something outside are window. We were living at the time on the backside of Myakka State Park. This area of Myakka State Park is very desolate, very isolated. Besides ur regular wild animals only other thing that would be walking around would be ur Florida marijuana growers in the swamps out here. My wife & i have lived in Florida 30yrs and both are avid outdoors types.  I hung out in these woods in this area for over 20yrs,and thought I had heard everything, my wife also. Well anyway when we woke up and heard something out are widow, we had a very strong odor of something coming thru are window. My wife & i looked at each other with looks on are face ,with wonder, we both said at the same time, what the hell is out there, right as we said that this thing shreeked almost human sounding, but a real wild shreking...I was going to send our lab & pit bull after it but we couldn't get them out of our room,& they had never been scared of anything.Then I went to check on are little girl,she slept thru this. When this thing screemed in our window, to reach the window from outside it would have to be at least 7ft tall. We did not dare go outside, espically since our dogs wanted no part of what ever it was...",
