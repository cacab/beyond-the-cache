  "date": "1976-09-01",
  "observed": "I just read of a woman whom now is 39 and her sighting was in 1976. That blew me away, my sighting was the same year. I was 12 years old when my parents built our house right next to my grandparents, and then over a foot bridge to my great grandparents house. I had free run of the properties. They went all the way to I-76, Greenwich Road, and just down the road was Route 57.  I was a child who basically tested the waters. I can remember it was warm out, sunny, the leaves were falling since we were heading into fall, the air smelled of leaves. I was standing on my great grandparents property. With permission, I could basically go all the way back to the highway, usually with a friend. I was told never to go further then great granny's woodline. That day I went further past her woodline into the woods that was on the right hand side of the house. Through the woods was another families home. I started walking through the forbidden path and about half way through is when I saw something brown and hairy in a squatting position. At first, I thought it was a dog. Then it stood up! It was at least seven feet tall or more. I stood there in a frozen position and stared at it. I ran before it could turn around. I was in total fear. The back was covered in hair, the arms hung down, it had very broad shoulders, the body was covered in brown hair. I stumbled across this website, and still felt kinda shy about telling people, but that is my story.",
