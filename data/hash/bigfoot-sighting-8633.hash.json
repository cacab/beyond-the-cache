  "observed": "Driving tractor and trailer on US 6 appox. 6 mi east of Coudersport Pa. on May 7th at appox. 10:30 pm. Going up Denton Hill just past the ski area, there was a car in front of me appox. 100 yds. There was lightning to the west of my location but not yet raining where I was at.  The highway going up the hill has a passing lane. The car in front of me was in the driving lane and then swerved into the passing lane as if to miss something. After he swerved I noticed a large black figure beside the road. It was standing upright on the shoulder of the road on my right about to go up a steep incline to the woods. Just saw it for a second then it disapeared. Took a second for me to make out what it was. The car in front of me did not stop or put on it's brake, so  I'm not sure if I really saw something or it was my imagination. Appeared to be appox. 7 to 8 feet tall. using the car as a reference point for height. Total black with long arms and legs.",
