  "observed": "We've been reading your reports for a long time now and decided we needed to tell our story.  My husband and I live in rural Snoqualmie Valley only 3 1/2 miles from the town of Duvall. One night, while camping in our front yard, we were startled by a very loud moaning sound that came from up the hill from us.  It was about 12:30 AM when we first started hearing the moans.  All of us had the hair on the backs of our necks (and everywhere else) standing straight up because of the frightening sounds we were hearing.  This kept up for quite a while until we all decided we'd sleep better if we went indoors.  I think if we had thought it was a Bigfoot, we would have run inside the house immediately.  One person we told about what we heard said it was probably the neighbor butchering hogs!  I'm no expert, but I don't think anyone in their right mind would want to wake up all the neighbors by butchering their hogs after midnight.  Besides, it didn't sound like anything we had ever heard before.  We all thought--if ever you were going to make a movie about ghosts wailing--this would be the perfect sound! On 2 other occasions within a few weeks of this first incident, my husband heard the same loud moaning through the woods at night. Years later one of my step daughters and I had watched a TV program called Northwest Afternoon.  That day they had played a Bigfoot moaning and it sounded just like what we heard!  Both my stepdaughter and I had talked to each other after watching the program and we both agreed it was the same sound we had heard years earlier.",
