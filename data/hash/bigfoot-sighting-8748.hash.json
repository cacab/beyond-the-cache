  "observed": "I was walking home with my baby in my front pack and my dog through (edited) on Bainbridge Island around 6 PM last mid-May. The evening weather was warm. About 50 yards in front of me in the woods, I heard branches breaking and much noise, as if two peple were fighting in the woods. The noise stopped and I saw a brown furry tall figure, about 11 feet tall, standing behind a tree with its left side exposed. Even my dog stopped and stared. If it had been a deer or raccoon, my dog would have taken off in chase. We stood there watching for about 2 minutes. Then the figure vanished. We continued on the path to the point where we saw the figure, about 25 feet off the path in the trees, to realize that where the figure stood, there is a dropoff with a steep slope. We heard nor saw anything more. We were dumbfounded as to what it was. Almost exactly one year later, just two nights ago, there was an owl screeching at 4 AM in the same vicinity as the first sighting last year, then, a tremendously loud series of ape-like sounds.",
