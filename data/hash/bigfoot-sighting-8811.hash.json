  "observed": "Having had the benefit of finding a footprint when I was 13, my interest in bigfoot has led me to privately research the subject for many years. Thanks to your website I have been able to concentrate much of my attention on Oklahoma, since it has many more reports than my native Kansas, which has not been updated. On that note, myself and some other interested participants traveled to Leflore County in SE Oklahoma in an attempt to find some evidence, since this area is a hotspot of reported activity. Traveling to Honobia, we met a few of the inhabitants who were more than willing to provide us with information and possible locations where we might have some type of encounter. Please note that this is near the exact location that the Mysterious Encounters team filmed the Oklahoma Wildman episode. We too visited the house where they set up operations and noted how the previous occupants had left so abruptly that most of their possessions remained in the home, including a refrigerator full of spoiled food. Having set up camp we proceeded to stay up until near dawn, occasionally playing the Sierra bigfoot vocalizations, and patroling the area. Nothing was seen or heard throughout the night. The following day, while walking through the area, myself and one other located three full footprints and one potential track on a road leading up the hillside toward the top of the hill. While we did not apply plaster-of -paris to the tracks or accurately measure them, we did take photos. Using dollar bills as gauges to measure the length not only of the footprint, but also the stride between tracks, I would quite accurately estimate that the prints themselves were over sixteen inches long and the stride nearly five and a half feet. These tracks were located on a sloping road traveling upwards at nearly 40 degrees. Also of note: I understand that many people will disregard such tracks as those of bears or other large animals, but we also took photos of bear tracks we found near the Little River located nearby. Anyone who has any idea of what animal tracks look like can tell the difference. They are not even close. These tracks were huge.",
