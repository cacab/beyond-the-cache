  "observed": "My grandaughter was driving and spotted a man in a field where men are never seen as it is flood for rice. She went back to see what he was doing. As this is a very senstive area due to 9/11. As he came closer she could see he was huge, then she could see the hair he was covered with. He was bending over as if looking for something doing this several times she was still at good distance. She knew no one would believe her so she took several pictures. Two of which came out. One coming and the other going away after she honked her horn. We think these pictures could be of great interest. They were just taken Wednesday [June 9, 2004]. Thanks for your time.",
