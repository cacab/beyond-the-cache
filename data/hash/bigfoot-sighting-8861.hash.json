  "observed": "It was early July of 1988, and I was a Boy Scout at Worth Ranch for Summer Camp in Palo Pinto, Texas. I didn't see much but a white figure shooting behind a grove of trees on top of a nearby rocky ledge.  We were camped near the river bottom, my troop and I, and I was all by myself at the camp site.  I heard a rustling noise up top, following by a few screams. I see two of my fellow scouts come running down the hill, shaking.  The told me of a large, humanoid white ape creature with long arms walking a cow trail.  They said it screamed like a woman and ran off when they made eye contact  with it. The boys were shaking for hours afterward and were afraid to sleep at night all week. I only saw it from a distance, but I could tell it was upright, white and mobile. The two boys who saw the creature deny it ever happened, dismissing it as the result of overactive, juvenile imaginations.  But I know there was something.  Whether it was a Boy Scout camp staff member in a costume trying to scare us, or an actual creature, I will never be sure.  But it did match several legends of an albino ape in the area -- one of which, Hugo's Monster, is a totally ficitious, Frankenstein-genre tale.  But it could be based on some degree of truth for all I know. That is all I can recall.",
