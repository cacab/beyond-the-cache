It looked slim or gaunt. My brother was driving a feed truck back from Tuscumbia, Mo. going north on Hwy 17 about 2 miles from the Marys Home turn off. As he rounded a curve to the left was when he saw it in the road about 200 yds. ahead. He looked away for just a second and It was gone. When he got back to Jefferson City, Mo., in about 30 min, he called me and told me about it, and that he was taking another load down to meet him there. I did so. He showed the place and then he left to make his delivery. I walked up and down both sides of the road and found where somthing had walked up to the fence from the east. The grass was thick and mashed down but no imprints were left. I also noticed the cattal acting spooked. I am making this report for my brother, whom would not.",
