  "observed": "On Kelly Hill Mt., my 16 year-old son left an evening family Barbeque group to go grouse hunting in the immediate vicinity. He ran back to the group a few minutes later, white around his lips, very shaken up and scared to report: \"I just saw a tall, dark, hairy thing step over the fence (4-wires high).\"  After a few questions as to  \"where and when\" it happened, my son-in-law, my son, and myself headed out to the location. We all noted a very strong, pungent odor in the area of the occurence. Upon looking in the tall grass, we saw where the grass had been pressed down but saw no clear print(s). We were all well-armed and searched the area for several minutes, only to find nothing......except to smell the pungent odor, which lingered. Whatever had been there had left the vicinity. My son told us the \"thing\" was walking upright, had long hair \"all over\" and said \"it stepped over the fence\" and was \"real tall\". He said it \"walked like a man\". We three went back up the hill to our barbeque and decided it would be of no use to tell the locals, because they'd laugh at us. For certain though, we told other family members at the fireside, all five of them.",
