  "observed": "One morninig after leaving the camp ground in the national forrest to get a biscuit me and my father saw something big walking across the road. I couldnt identyfi it. it was walking then stoped looked at us real fast and steped off the road into the woods. their was a road sign when this thing walked in front of it it completly blocked out the sign. I asked my dad if he had seen what I had seen and he said yes. Isaid thank god I thought I was going crazy or something. We pulled up to where the thing steped off the road and looked around nothing nothing at all the brush which this thing had went throught was not even moving. we got back in the truck and started driving my dad said what in the world was that. We tried to rule out every other possiblity but big foot but they didnt work out to good. First Isaid it could have been a bear or some one riding a horse. But my dad said if it was a bear it wouldnt be walking upright unlees it was thratened or try ing to reach for food and it wasent presnt,and bears arent around the stanley county area.Then my dad said maybe it was a horse because there are horse riding trailand a horse camp in the national forrest,But theres one problem Something as big as a horse or a bear should have upset the brush and it should have been moving but it wasnt. Some thing very fast and very smart had to have steped over te brush. After all this did only happen in 30 secs while we drove down the road. And Iprety much Agree with my dad. Thanks for your time. Ps I couldnt spell the name of the national forrest its one of those native american words I always have troble with those.",
