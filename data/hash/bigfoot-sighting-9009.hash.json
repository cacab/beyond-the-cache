  "observed": "While camping in the White Mountains of NH in March 2001, I came across bi-pedal prints in heavy snow.  Each foot print was about 18 inches long by 8 inches wide, and the stride was 24 to 30 inches between each print.  They were located in 100-150 yards off a snowmodible trail, and went even deeper.  This was were I was camping for 3 days, so I did not want to pay attention.  However, after considerable thought about the circumstances, my observations of the environment make the tracks interesting.  In march of 2001, there was fairly heavy snows, ranging from 3 to 4 feet deep.  The week before the camping trip was very warm, so the snow began to melt.  There was stil snow, so when it got cold again the next week, there was an inch or so of ice on top of the snow.  When wearing snowshoes, the weight dispersal would break the ice in a large cricle, simply caving in some of the ice.  When wearing snow boots, the ice could not support your weight on such a small area, and your foot would go straight through the ice.  Applying this to the prints, there was no evidence that the prints were made before the snow melt, as they then would have exihibted the melted ice over the print.  There was no way these could have been made by snowshoes then (they wouldnn't even be the same shape) and it was way to big to be anybodies boot that would make this kind of straight through the ice print.  There were no distinctivly human markings ( i.e. ice breakers or tread marks).  My only regreat was not following them",
