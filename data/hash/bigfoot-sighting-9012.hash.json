  "observed": "We live at a rural residence south of Hibbing. Shortly before 5 on Saturday July 17th, 2004, my husband had gotten up and started his coffee when he started hearing strange noises. He said they sounded like a low cry or calling noise. He said he had never heard anything like it before and so he stepped out the door and thought he would walk down to get the previous days mail and see if he could determine what the noise was. When he was next to his car he looked to the left into a growth of pines about 50 ft away and he saw a figure there that was 6-7 ft tall and not in clothing and covered in fur head to foot. It was on two feet. He looked at it for several seconds and was too stunned himself to move and then it noticed him and ran off to a field or the woods just north of us. It ran in human form and not on 4 legs. My husband went to the area after but there was not much he could tell on the pine needles but in the grass he could see large footprints pressed down. Later that day my father walked out to the grassy area and followed his tracks a while and  he came upon feces that he says were not from deer or bear.",
