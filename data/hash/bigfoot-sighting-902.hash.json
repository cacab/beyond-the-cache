  "observed": "A friend and I were gathering firewood around 5:00 p.m. in the evening, there was maybe an inch of new snow on the ground and a moderate fog had settled in on the mountain side.  We were maybe 200 or 300 yards from camp up on the mountain side.  As we gathered small sticks and branches from dead trees  I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, and a huge hairy like animal, maybe 7 or 8 feet tall ran infront of us. The creature  was maybe 10 or 15 yards ahead of us in some thicker timber. The creature ran in front of us for maybe 30 or 40 yards but because of the fog we lost track of him.  The creature ran or moved quickly on two legs for the entire time we observed him. There is no doubt in my mind that the creature was not a bear, but something else, such as a Sasquatch. Two days later while hunting I heard a terrible scream like nothing I had ever heard before, it wasn't a sreech owl or coyote or elk, it was increadibly high pitched and echoed off a canyon wall.  Just the thought of it still makes my hair stand on end.",
