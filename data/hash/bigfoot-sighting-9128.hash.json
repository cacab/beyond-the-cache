  "observed": "My family's property bordered a small creek, the other side of the creek basicly was the north central cascades. An area composed of huge tracts of USFS land mixed with clearcuts. The creek supports a modest run of salmon, my dogs and I were out to see if any fish had made it up into \"our\" part of the river. The field we were walking in is bordered by very thick brush that grows along the fence.  Beyond that lies the creek. The far bank is 20 feet high, covered with cedar, hemlock and brush. We were walking through the field when the most earth shattering sound stopped us dead in our tracks. The sound was best described as a \"hoot\", but delivered with incredible volume...HOOOOOOTTT!!! We stopped dead in our tracks. I knew exactly what I was hearing. Frozen, the feeling of terror was overwhelming. This lasted around 5 seconds, when the second HOOOOOOTT!! rang out. The plan was clear, we ran. Fast. As we ran, the final HOOOOOOT!! came from behind us, streaking thru thigh high fieldgrass, I was sure that I was seconds away from having my arms ripped off by a mountain devil. I can laugh now about how I felt, but after talking with other friends who have had run-ins with Sasquach, the common thread in our experiences seems to be uncontrolable fear. Like being hunted. The dogs and I ran into the house, breathless and bug eyed with terror, I made my mother come out to the backyard where we listened for the noise. Of course, all was quiet. ",
