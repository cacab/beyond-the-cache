  "date": "2004-08-10",
  "observed": "I was headed north on Hwy 59 into Atlanta, Texas.  I was the only one on the road for as far as I could see.  I came to an S curve in the road.  It went to a curve to the right and then back to a curve to the left.  I made the first curve and when I was coming aroung the other curve I saw this huge beast just step over a six strand barbed wire fence. I slammed on my brake and then just took off. I was scared to death.  This was no man and damn sure not a bear.It had to be at least 8 to 8 1/2 feet tall and weight no less than 500.bs. I weigh 230lbs and it was at least twice my size! It's hair was a really dark brown and not as long as I thought it would be. It looked to be covered with 6 to 8 inch hair. It's chest and abdomen didn't seem to be as hairy and I could see it's eyes, nose, and mouth, so I assume they were not hairy either.  As I've said before when I made the curve it was stepping over a 4' fence like it was nothing.  It saw me and didn't run, but just turned it's head and continued to walk down the fence line.  I should have taken a longer look, but I was really freaking out at this point so I just drove on into Atlanta.",
