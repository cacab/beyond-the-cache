  "observed": "First off I was a young boy when this happened so please forgive some memory errors. I was riding my bike in the woods and going home on a trail, I could \"feel\" something watching or \"following\" me. I raced out of the woods to a better trail I could hear in the bush as something was keeping pace with me. The bush was being thrashed about as if it were chasing me or just following me. I cleared the woods and turned to look and I could see something that had reddish-brown hair all over it. It stood very tall well over 8 feet. It had \"blackened skin\" along the facial areas that I could see. This incident has haunted my childhood and adulthood dreams. The area in which I had seen this \"creature\" is now cleared and a subdivision is built upon it. Most of it is still very wooded. As a young boy I hunted these woods often and would smell a horrid stench and often attributed it to a decaying animal, but after the chase I quickly remembered the smell as it filled the air. I was now looking at as this thing stood there. I remember my father telling my about bigfoot and that he and some friends had seen something he could not identify as a boy in West Virginia.",
