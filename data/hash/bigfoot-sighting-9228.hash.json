  "observed": "Yesterday morning out I went outside to feed my dogs around 5:00 AM.  I was wondering where my dogs were. I found them under my house.  They started to bark toward the back so I went inside and looked out the back window.   I seen something looking right at me. It was big, tall and hairy, with eyes red.  I stared at it a long time, my wife came and seen it too.  She got so scared she told me to not take my son to school yet. Next night we heard the dog howling, my son was not back from his friend's house and he had the truck.  My son ran to the door hitting the door hard.   He was yelling, Dad let me in, hurry! Dad! Hurry! I opened the door, my son fell down. He was scared.  He said he seen something walking on the dirt road and when he got out of the truck that thing started to run after him.  My son said he will not walk around at night after what he saw.",
