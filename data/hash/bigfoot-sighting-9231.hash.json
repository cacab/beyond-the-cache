  "observed": "During the middle of the night I started hearing vocalizations that I was not able to identify.  At first I thought it might be a screech owl.  Although the call was notable different.  Over a one hour period I heard several calls from two different sources.  At about 2 I heard something moving outside my tent.  Using a large mag lite I looked out from inside my tent to see a large human like figure about 20 yards from the tent.  It looked very large and dark colored.  As soon as I turned the light on it the creature turned and ran back into the brush.  I then took all four of my flashlights out and spent the rest of the evening sitting up with a single light on at a time until sun rise.",
