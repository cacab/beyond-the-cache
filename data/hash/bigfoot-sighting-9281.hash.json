  "observed": "I get up every morning about 5:15 am to get ready for work. On this morning I got up a little early, so I decided to eat a banana. I wanted to look outside to see if there was any deer or rabbits outside. Out of the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of a figure that was huge and black. I thought it was a deer at first, but the more I could see of it, I realized it wasn't. This thing stood up and walked right through the crab apple trees like nothing. Then out of the corner of my left eye, I could see another figure smaller in size, but still as black as the big one. It went running like a child after its parents through the crab apple bushes, kinda wobbling. As It moved through the bushes, I could see the trees shake back and forth hard. I wondered where the big one was and looked to my right, and there it was standing in some thick brush staring right at me in the window. I got sick to my stomach! We stood there staring at each other for less than a minute. I took one step back from the window, then it looked at my dog kennel, and started walking up the hill. The trees were shaking back and forth as far as I could see and then they were gone. The night before, I threw almost rotten bananas and cantaloupe into the back yard. It was the same general location that I first noticed the large dark thing. They were gone by the next day.",
