  "observed": "I was walking with my dog down a dirt road near my grandparents house. It was about 8pm and still light out. We were about 1/2 mile down the road when my dog started barking and going crazy. She would just stand between my legs and growl and bark, this is a big dog, a German Shepard. Finally I got her to calm down. I heard some grunting and moving around in the woods to our right, I figured it was a deer or wild hog. As I moved closer, I saw it raise up from behind a fallen tree. I'd say it was roughly 7' tall. I would guess it was 300-400 lbs, kinda reddish brown hair covering its body. Its face looked like a monkey in a way. I couldn't move, my dog was going crazy trying to stay between me and what ever it was. It was only there for a flash. I know it turned and ran off and my dog gave chase to it, and I turned and ran home. About 30-45 minutes later, my dog came home, panting, but unhurt. I have heard all kinds of noises at night there all my life. They sound like a \"whoomping\" sound, kinda like a howler monkey I've seen on the Discovery Channel.",
