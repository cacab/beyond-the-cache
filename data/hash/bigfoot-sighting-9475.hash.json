  "observed": "My co-worker and I were on a turkey farm at about 12:30AM. one night in October,2003. I began smelling a strange smell that I had never smelled before on a birdfarm. I began shining my Q-beam spotlight around in the darkness. I noticed something standing behind the barn across from me. I could see the animal picking up acorns or something off the ground.The animal didn't like my spotlight because it would block the light with its hand. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I ran over to my coworker, that was working on the other feed truck to warn him as to what I had seen. He laughed and said for me to quit tryin to scare him. I told him that I was serious, and he would see it if it was still there, since it was behind the last barn that he had to pump feed in. I noticed he was startled when he shined his spotlight and saw this large creature for himself. He claimed that this creature started walking toward him, and it really shook him up, because he ran to the front of his truck and sped to the front of the farm where I waited on him. He was white as a ghost. He claimed that this creature was between 8 to 10Ft. in height and as broad as two linebackers. I told him that's exactly what I had seen .",
