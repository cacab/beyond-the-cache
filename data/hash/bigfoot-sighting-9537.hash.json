  "observed": "My wife and I were returning from Galion, Ohio back to our home southeast of Mt. Gilead. As we approached the intersection of SR 61 and TR 75 I noticed a large black thing run (west to east) across the road about .25-.1 mi ahead. We looked at each other and asked, \"Did you see that?\". We both saw the same thing. I slowed down to see if we could see when it went, no such luck we didn't see anything more of it. It sent chills down our spines. We talked about it a few more minutes and then the subject changed to something else. Later that evening I telephoned a friend in Columbus and told my story. As I was describing its gait to my friend--just like the classic bigfoot film footage on TV. My wife then looked at me and said, \"That is exactly as I had seen it\".",
