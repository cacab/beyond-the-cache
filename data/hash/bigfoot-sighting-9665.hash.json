  "observed": "I was in elementary school and I am 24 now, so I can't remember exactly where we were except that it was in Washington, in the forest, and it had to be at a fairly high elevation  because I remember there were patches of snow on the ground in some spots.  I was with my parents and their friends and we were on this back road somewhere and something was wrong with the friends' truck so I remember that we stopped and they were looking at the truck and something caught my eye. It was a very tall person with thicker and longer than usual arms and legs; I could only see the silhouette of him and he seemed to be in a hurry and he was crossing the road in front of where we had stopped. I didn't say anything at the time, I wasn't frightned, just totally amazed by what I just saw. And still to this day I know what I saw and wasn't just seeing things as a child.  So I KNOW this was either a bigfoot or someone dressed up like one. And it wasn't anyone in my party because I remember looking at them all to see if they had just seen what I had, but they were all occupied with something else.",
