  "observed": "My wife and I saw a small childlike bigfoot while in SouthCarolina a year ago. It crossed the road in front of us, about 25 yardsahead of the car. It stopped in the middle of the road and looked at us,then it jumped to the other side into a swamp and was gone. The time itwas around 1:30 am. The small ape like creature was about 5 foot tall withlong hair on its arms, legs and face. The color was dark brown and it seemedquite silky. It looked to be proportionate in size to a 10 or 11 year oldboy. One striking thing about it is the walking gait it had, not like a man and not like a monkey. It would be very hard to imitate such a walk.He looked directly at us for an instant. It acted like it was a aware of itself. The place is a little bridge a few miles east of Sumter, SC whichis next to Shaw Air Force Base. There also was a sign that said, the black or dark swamp or something like that.",
