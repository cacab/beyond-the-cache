  "observed": "My sighting happened in the Summer of 1986. At the time I was 12 yrs old at the time. I was at my Grandmother's house outside of Bradford, AR.(about 50 miles NE of Little Rock) My Grandparents owned a large farm where the White Co. line and the Jackson Co lines met. It was around 9-930am. I had slept in the guest room that night. When I woke up I had the feeling as if someone was watching me. Their was a window next to the bed and as I looked to see if some one was there I noticed a Bigfoot staring at me through the top pane of the window. I am 6'5\" tall and I can only see through the bottom of the window, that may give you an idea of his/her height. He/she was a reddish-brown color. I just looked and stared for probably 30-45 seconds. I never felt threatened or scared at any time. After this time had passed I wanted to see more, so I tried to step out of the bed really soft and when I did the rug that was on the hardwood floor slipped and I lost my footing. As I was down on my knee the Bigfoot stared at me. I was very puzzled. I was at a point where I just had to see what was going on. I then turned and tried to run to the back of the house where I could see him/her. When I got to the back door I seen it running through a field and toward an old barn. It had a very distinctive running style it's hands were straight down and flat. I tried to get my Grandmother and Moms attention but they didn't get there in time. He/she had a very slim, muscular build.",
