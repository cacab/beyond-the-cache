  "observed": "Amherst County, VA  US 60 100 yds. west of state route 778 approx 10:pm  Dec. 7, 2003. I had passed that point about an hour earlier and the area was loaded with deer. Had to slow way down to avoid a collision. There were at least 8 there at 9:pm. I was taking my sons, who are in the Nat'l Guard back to the University after their \"drill.\" (They are now at Ft.Dix being retrained for an all-expense paid trip to Iraq.) On the way back Eastbound down the mountain after delivering my sons back to their dorm (their car was off-line), I slowed way down as I approached the area.  I looked carefully to avoid any animal contact In the brights, as I looked right I saw a yellow reflection first. As I got closer, I saw the top part of an obviously large creature. Its arms were spread out to either side. I could see hair hanging from the arms. The elbows were bent slightly. The head appeared flat-faced, huge and slightly higher at the rear. The shoulders were broad. The color was dark. A slight sulfurous odor was detected. The steep bank hid most of the creature. It was perfectly still.  I almost felt it thought it was not visible to passing vehicles. I went back to the area about 10 days later and saw some scuff marks on the bank side. This area is criss-crossed by many deep ravines and creeks. After discovering your great sight, my interest was pricked. I've hesitated to turn this one in because it was so fleeting.",
