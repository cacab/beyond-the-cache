  "observed": "I was parking out in the woods with my date late one fall evening. All of a sudden my car began to shake.  I looked out the drivers side-window and found myself looking at a huge face. We stared at each other not over 3 inches from each other through the glass.  I hurriedly started the car and put the headlights on.  The first thing we saw was that now the animal was on the passenger side of the car and on all fours as if it were trying to stay out of the light from the headlights.  The animal hurriedly covered the 35 feet in front of the car and into the woods.  It only stood up as it reached the trees. The speed that it moved was amazing.  It was much faster than any deer. It was over 7 feet tall, brown and had a large head though we could not see the face. We quickly left the area and headed back to town. It took over an hour to get my girlfriend calmed down.",
