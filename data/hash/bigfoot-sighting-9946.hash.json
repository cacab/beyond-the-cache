  "observed": "I was going for a late night drive. I drove up past Cougar on 503. When I hit snow on a couple of corners, I started to get a little nervous about driving up any farther but still I chose to keep going. I had been seeing animals all night so I was really keeping my eyes open. When I slowed down to turn around, my car died. While trying to start it I was looking forward and noticed a large object standing on the side of the road which looked like a large man but I couldn't tell because it was out of the reach of my headlights. When my car started up the object quickly turned and strided off into the timber. That's when I knew it wasn't just a tree or anything like that. I have been up in those parts of the woods a lot and never seen anything like that. When I saw it turn away from me I couldn't calm down. I was terrified - the hair on my neck was standing up. It was just not a normal feeling. I believe I saw a bigfoot standing in front of my car along the edge of the road.",
