  "observed": "I submitted this report, I thing back in october(i think) and did not see anything posted or had any contact and omitted my phone number as no one in my household has been told of this story but will resubmit fully. I'm unsure of exact year but I had returned to the area in june of 2000 and I think it happened the following fall of 2000 or 2001. Me and a buddy(him driving) were out driving backroads spotting deer as it was near hunting season if I recall correctly. We often drove the backroads out here doing just that......spotting wildlife. It was roughly around 1AM. We were heading south on Foster Valley Road in Tioga county New York and approaching one of the main country roads(Day Hollow Road) and were within 1/2 mile of it......or there abouts, traveling about 30mph. As we were approaching the S's we could see the approaching lights of an oncoming car. Their headlights would have shined away to the uphill side (east side) of the road and they might not have even seen the creature due to location, light direction and visible location in the turns. We passed the car at about the same time we passed the creature and the headlights kind of obsured my vision of the creature but my buddy was focused on it and says he was not so bad and he probably got a more vivid look than I did as i lost good clear vision due to eye adjusting to the oncoming glare. The road is a bit windy and as your approaching Day Hollow there is a couple of slight switch back \" S \" turns. When heading south, right along that section there is a very steap bank at road edge to your right side with no guardrail and bank at it's highest might be 15 feet and drops down to a slightly tree'd slightly open flat so to speak. A person could easily jump from the road and land in the flat it is that steap. The S turns are just about as perfectly inbetween the two closest houses to the area. There are NO street lights in that section and a very dark section it is. Due to the direction we were traveling and location of the headlights. Well we could see \"something/someone\" standing right on the edge of the road but on the bank. This bank is extemely short and steap. I would think it be a challenge for any person to stand or climb that bank but here is what we thought of as a person standing right there. It was DIRECTLY infront of us and we could see that it was looking at the other approaching car even though it's headlights were not even close to being fixed on it. We spotted this \"person\" probably around 50 yards away so we had some time to try and focus. Even though the encounter actually happened within a short time frame I can look back on it as if it was slow motion and is permanently engrained in my mind. As we approached this creature we didn't realize what it was or how big it really was till just after passing it. The comments inside the truck were kinda humorous and no offense is intended towards anyone peron inparticular but kind of go along with the sighting. Now the location of this thing in relation to the road and time of occurance was quite quite a dangerous spot for a \"person\" and most people would have probably stepped back away from the road but keeping in mind one step back is about 6 feet down easy. The comments as we approached were with some explitives and without being offensive here something like..... Holy cow, what kind of idiot would be standing there dressed in all black hooded sweatshirt. I don't know but they better step back. Damn it looks like one BIG woman(torso completely visible and appeared large chested with what I'd figure as breasts) Ya and why she all dressed in dark with a hooded sweatshirt on(looking back on it now I'd give a smoked charcol dark grey) Damn they better step back if they don't wanna get hit(we actually slowed a bit due to oncoming car and passing at location of creature so we needed the full road and edge of shoulder to pass the car) The creature seemed to be looking more at the other vehicle and didn't turn to look at us till we were just about to hit/pass. She wasn't maybe five feet from the side of the truck and I looked her in the face out the side window as passing. At that moment we both got a decent look at her face. When she turned to look at us she kind of turned her torso and body with the head to do so. She was obviously big and even though she was standing on the bank, i'd have to say that we saw about 5 feet of the creature from about waist to high upper upper on up and looking back on it now and knowing the bank that she probably had about 4 feet we couldn't see below the bank edge. Her arms wer almost to the level of the road. As we passed and got a glimps of her face the comments continued and were something like....... OH MY GOD is she butt ugly. Ya she is, she had a pig face, did you see that snout of a nose(there was no snout at all but a large very wide open nostraled slightly upturned nose). Man is she ugly, she looks like she got beat with a couple ugly sticks out here in the woods. Ya she sure as hell has one hell of an ape face. At that moment, with the ape face comment. both of us turned to each other to see the expression on each others faces as the realization of what we may have just passed WAS. We did not turn around. we did not go back to look ...... I honestly didn't want to. The reason I say hooded sweat shirt is..... well we've all seen people with one on and we all know how they kind of have a pointed head where the hood is sown together. well she had the same kind of coned head. We didn't realize we were looking at hair and not a sweat shirt. She had a humanish face but man for a human she was very very hampered in the looks department. She was definitely what I would call breasted and large roundish belly and large torso and had to be all of 8 feet if not bigger.",
