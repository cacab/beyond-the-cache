  "observed": "I am an X-ray repair man. I traveled between Kalamazoo, Battlecreek, Coldwater and Niles Michigan. Most of my work was at night. I usally took back roads as it was faster than driving out of the way to get on the interstate.  On several occasions in the area know as Gooselake, Michigan. On Gooselake road, I observed a big creature cross the road in front of me. Approximately 20 feet in front of me. Upright, Redish in color, and tall. Maybe 7 to 8 feet. The first time I saw it I wasn't sure that I wasn't sleepy or my eyes playing tricks on me.  The next week when I went through there I was going slower and watching for it.I was paying close attention and there it was again. On the side of the road  with what looked like road kill or something.  It was smelling this thing and examining it very carefully.  I sat in the middle of the road (in my car) for about three minutes when it gets up and starts walking towards my truck. I was about 30 feet away this time. When it got within ten feet I started backing up to keep a distance between me and it. It was dead on in my headlights.  I could see it had sexual organ (male). This wasn't anyone wearing a costume. It scared the the living daylights out of me. I backed up a liitle farther and it stopped coming towards me. It just turned away and walked down into the ditch at the side of the road and walked into the woods. I stepped on the gas and got out of there. I never took that road again. And, until now I've never told anyone about this for fear of ridicule.",
