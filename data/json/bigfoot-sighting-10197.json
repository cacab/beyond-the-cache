  "observed": "Me and my friend were looking for a place to hunt squirrels in about September of probably 1993. We were driving down the road on our way to McPherson bridge, an old condemned bridge that crosses Shoal Creek. We saw what we or I at first thought was a deer or something about 50 yards off the road but about 100 yards in front of us. It started running away from us at a 90 degree angle and was fast but when it got about 200 yards it stood up and ran on two legs and you could its arms swinging real long arms. I guess it had to be at least 7 feet tall. It was about the same color as a white-tailed deer in the summer-time, light reddish brown. It ran to the woods about 500 yards away and turned 90 degrees and started walking. This is when I really knew something weird was going on. You could plainly see his arms swinging. It looked somewhat like a man when far away. Me and my friend really were both speechless and just sat there saying what the hell? We mentioned it to my wife and his girlfriend and they just laughed. But the other day we talked about it for some reason and we concluded that it must have been bigfoot. It was kinda just like I blocked it out for years but when he asked me about it I can remember just like yesterday.",
