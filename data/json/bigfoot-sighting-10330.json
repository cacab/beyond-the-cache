  "observed": "My girlfriend and I were driving home from work in the winter of 2003. We had several inches of snow, so we were moving slow. I was driving down State RT 56.  I looked to the farm field on my left and noticed something walking along the creek. I slowed down to get a better look and asked my girlfriend if she could see what I was watching.  She said yes.  I pulled our truck over as far as I could get and got out.  I walked across the road to get a better look.  What we saw plain as day was covered in reddish brown hair, walked upright, had a conical shaped head, long arms, stocky build and was at least six feet tall.  We watched this thing for several minutes until we had cars backed up.  I got back into the truck and we turned off of the road to the next left where the creek crossed and the ditch turned into a small thicket which is the direction what we both agreed, without a doubt was bigfoot, was heading.  We waited till it got dark to see if anything came out.  Nothing did.  We went to both entrances of the farm fields and saw no tracks of anything.  I am an avid hunter and fisherman and have no trouble distinguishing camoflage from hair at the distance the subjet was from us, which was about two hundred yards.  We only recently told our family and close friends  about what we saw.",
