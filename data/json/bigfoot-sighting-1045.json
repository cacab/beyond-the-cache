  "observed": "The appearance of the thing was just as I have seen on tv stories and descriptions I have heard of.  As far as the behavior of it, it was very shy as it appeared to not want to be seen.  My son and I had been deer hunting on a local farm.  When time came to leave, we met up and started back to my truck. About 50 yards down our path we heard something coming out of a cedar thicket and we both saw it.  It stood app. 8 feet tall and had long brown hair all over it.  We stopped and it stopped at the same time.  We didn't know what to say or do.  Then it just stepped back into the thicket and went away out of sight.  We got back to my truck as fast as we could, but we could hear something following us the whole time.  But it did stay completly out of sight.  I haven't told too many people about this, because they always laugh at us or start making jokes.  I know I'll never forget it as long as I live.  It was really scary.  That thing was huge.",
