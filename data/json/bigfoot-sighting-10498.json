  "observed": "In the early fall of 1979, my cousin and I were following some trails through the woods near my home.  These were trails that myself as well as the other neighborhood kids frequented often on bikes as well as foot.  It was a sunny day and warm.  After going approxiametly 60 yards into the woods I looked up onto a hill that was to the left of the trail that we were traveling on.  There standing, looking directly at us, among some small pine trees, was a very large being.  It was standing straight up on two legs, it was huge, at least 7ft tall, covered with medium brown hair.  It was standing as if frozen, I can still picture its arms and hands for some reason;  his hands were just like a man's except larger and covered with hair.  It's face was not totally covered with hair.  I froze in place and whispered to my cousin \"what is that?\".  She thought I had seen something on the ground she was not looking on the hill.  I just took off running as fast as I could toward the road, out of the woods.  When we were a good distance away I then told my cousin what I had seen and later we returned with a stick and large rock in hand but there was not sign of it.  There was also nothing on that hill that could have been construed as being anything like I saw.",
