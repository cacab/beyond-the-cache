  "observed": "My brother-in-law and myself were walking along a creekbank in rural St.Clair Co. Alabama and we stumbled upon a print that we weren't sure what it was. It looked like a human foot.The print was about a size 9 or 10 in shoe sizes but only about 3 1/2\" wide and was approx. 2-3 deep in the dirt. I tried to replicate the depth with my foot but I had to stomp in the dirt with the heel of my boot to replicate the depth of the print. The print was not a bear or any other wildlife that we have seen in the woods as we are avid hunters. There were 2 prints,1 looked like it was walking out of the creek and stepped up on the bank with just the ball of its foot, then the track beside it was a full print as decribed before.",
