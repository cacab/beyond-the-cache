  "observed": "Back when I was 10-12 years old, my cousin and I was sitting on [a relative's] front porch in Buna, Texas looking out across a field. All of a sudden from the left side of the field a huge man like creature that was covered in hair was running out of the woods across the field, it turned and looked up our way for a second then jump a barb wire fence (with no problem). The fence was running towards the house through the middle of the field...and continued to run in behind the pond. The last thing that I remember seeing was he ducked to avoid a tree limb as he was running into the woods.....The field was 250-300 yards wide and as he ran from side to side was about 100-150 yards off. [Taken from email correspondence with the witness:] My cousin still gets chills when we talk about the thing we saw. As far as pictures provided by BFRO and other movies and books, that is what we saw. We was both very scared at that time. Wished I would have been older...we could have gotten all kind of footprints in the field. Whatever anyone thinks about a bigfoot being out there, I don't care. I know and my cousin knows there was at least one.",
