  "observed": "I WAS CAMPING NEAR BAKER LAKE, IN THE BAKER- SNOQUALMIE NATIONAL FOREST. I HAD GONE FOR A DRIVE DOWN THE MAIN ROAD NEAR THE CAMPGROUND. I TURNED OUT OF THE SHANNON CREEK CAMPGROUND EXIT BACK ONTO THE MAIN ROAD. AT THE STOP SIGN JUST BEFORE I TURNED, I HAPPENED TO LOOK UP THE HILL ACROSS FROM THE SIGN AND SPOTTED THE BIGFOOT. HE WAS ABOUT FIFTY FEET FROM ME SLIGHTLY UP THE HILL. ALL I SAW WAS THE BACK, SHOULDERS, HIPS AND TOP OF BUTTOCKS. IT WAS STILL AND HAD ITS BACK TO ME. THE HAIR COLOR WAS A LIGHTER SHADE OF RED AND SPARSE. I COULD SEE THE MUSCLES BENEATH THE HAIR. I TURNED THE CORNER AND DROVE DOWN THE ROAD, NOT WANTING TO DISTURB IT. I'VE GONE BACK TO THE SAME SPOT SINCE THEN LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING I COULD HAVER MISTAKEN FOR A BIGFOOT. THERE IS NOT!",
