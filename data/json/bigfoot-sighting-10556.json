As we approach it it stood up and walked backwards into center of road squated and looked at us then leaped over the inbankment. It was about 7 feet tall, big legs, small upper body with thin longer hair on chest and arms, short neck and short thick hair on legs, dark brown in color. We got within 20 to 30 feet of it. Our headlights on bright. The road stays in bad condition. Travel is very slow.",
