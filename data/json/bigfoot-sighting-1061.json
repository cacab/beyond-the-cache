  "observed": "At the time I was only about 9 years old, and my friend was going on a camping trip over in ruskin, fl. it was a weekend excersion just off the Little Manatee River. the first night we just herd funny screems that sounded like it was coming from down river. Not sure what it was so my friends dad loaded me and my friend in the boat and we went to see what it was. We thought someone was in trouble or some thing. We went down river but saw and herd nothing ant thought nothing more about it. THe next night about 2 or 3 a.m. i smelt a God awful oder that woke me up out of a dead sleep. I thought a skunk had invaded our camp (not uncommon in Florida).Slowly I grabbed my flashlight and tured it on. As soon as i clicked the button i herd some thing run through the palm palms, when I shined the light up I saw the upper back and head of a large animal running away. It happend so quik that it was a blurr, but i do know that the hair was a dark brown or black color. I hope this helps you in your search.",
