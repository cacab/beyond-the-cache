  "observed": "Around five years ago me and a buddy were mushroom hunting and came across about ten feet prints walking down a almost dried creek. The creek went from water to a muddy spot about 15'(?) long and then back to water. It looked like they walked out of the water into the mud making the prints then back into the water on the other side. The feet prints were from bare feet as the toe and heel impression were very reconizable. They were about the size of my size twelve shoe and had a longer leg stance then me (i'm about 5'10\"). They went east straight down the creek/ditch heading towards the Embarrass River which is about 1/8 mile away from the prints. There shouldn't have been anyone walking barefoot down a creek down in the bottoms so that's what really got our attention. There are no houses within miles and there are no campgrounds or any reason anyone other then farmers or hunters to be down there and I just can't conceive any of them not wearing boots and not to mention walking down a creek with water in it. We were going to get pictures but didn't get to it in time because it ended up raining a few days later.",
