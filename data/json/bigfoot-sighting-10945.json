  "observed": "As we were driving...I was watching closely at the roads and conditions, because my wife was driving and I was a bit nervous about that! As we were traveling north on I-77 near the 150 milemarker (I looked after the incident!)...I noticed something up ahead on the right hillside. It was a fairly steep, snow-covered hillside. I thought I saw something that looked like a very big man walking on this steep hill. As I turned my head (we were traveling about 65 mph...so we went by quickly)...I could SWEAR I saw this very tall \"image\" walking from right to left across this mountain side, maybe 30 yards from our car! He(IT) appeared to be covered somewhat with snow, like you would imagine a mountainman who was out in the wilderness hunting would look. But this was 3:30 in the morning! I had a very uneasy feeling and a rather stupid feeling. I still can NOT believe what I'm pretty damn sure I saw! ...and that was EITHER a very tall man, wearing allot of winter gear with either a hooded coat or long hair and a beard that barely glanced in our direction as we drove by....or something else that I would rather not venture to guess upon! THIS IS NOT A JOKE!!!!! I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE! I'm a 47 year old father of four. I am as serious as a heart attack about this  report! I reluctantly submit this and would rather not be ridiculed by anyone that knows that I did.",
