  "observed": "I cannot say for sure what this may have been, but I've never heard anything make a \"noise\" quite like this since, until listening to your audio samples. The area I grew up in is very rural in nature with only a few small towns here and there. The city of Rochester lies approximately 30-min to the east, and Buffalo about 45-min to the west.  My families land consists of 50 acres of farmland, with dense undergrowth and brush as well as a small corner of a much larger forrest on approximately 20 of those acres. A large man-made pond exists at a point where the dense underbrush begins and is bordered on one side to the north by a large/thick hedgerow which also has dense undergrowth on the otherside. About the time I was in 5th/6th grade, my friend Nat and I were back at the pond with mine and my younger brother's 10-pump single shot BB-guns. Call us sick or what not, but we used to throw Rice Krispies into the pond and try to shoot the Sunfish that would come up to eat them. Anyways, we had gone around the southern and western sides of the pond and decided to move to the northern side because it was somewhat more shallow and easier to see our \"prey\". Once we reached the northern end, the pond's edge was only about 10 feet from the hedgerow mentioned previously, and since we were pre-occupied with our \"hunt\" we had our backs turned to the hedgerow. After growing tired of shooting, we decided to call it quits. Noting that both of us still had BB's primed and chambered, we should get rid of them before going back to the house. Nat, not exactly being the country-boy, didn't know what I meant, so I said \"Just fire it off into the brush\" or something to that effect, and with that we both simultaniously fired into the brush. That's when something decided it was time to scare the crap outta us. Immediately after firing, something about 10 feet into the brush began screaming/howling sounding exactly like your recordings only with bass or \"power\" and shaking the small trees and brush violently. We couldn't see what it was due to the thickness of the hedgerow. Whatever it was then took off heading back towards the forrest, making the screams the entire way. Judging by the way the entire hedgerow from top to bottom was shaking vigerously whatever it was, was big. This all happened within a matter of seconds, and it was gone. After comparing the location and volume of the sounds as it moved, the distance it covered was impossible for a human to accomplish in that thick of vegetation. Nat and I literally looked at each other and screamed, and then hauled-ass the 500 meters back to my house. Nat moved to North Carolina in 8th grade and I never heard from him again. I don't know what it was, but I've heard of Bigfoot sightings down near Clarendon, where I used to play paintball a few years ago as well as on the Indian reservation towards Buffalo. I was only about 10 years old when this all took place, but proceeded to spend the rest of my childhood playing/hunting in the woods and consider myself \"knowledgable\" in a forrest environment. I have never heard such screams/noises since.",
