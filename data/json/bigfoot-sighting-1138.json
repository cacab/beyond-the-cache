  "observed": "I am not sure of the date. My daughter was 1-2 years old, so it would have had to have been in 1988 or 1989. We were going from Crocker, MO. to Waynesville/St. Robert, MO. to Wal-Mart.  We crossed the Waynesville/Crocker bridge on Hwy. 17 (North of Waynesville, South of Crocker) and were almost out of the \"Waynesville Corners\" --this highway has several corners and curves after the bridge because it has a bluff on one side and the Roubidoux Creek/Gasconade River on the other.  When we were almost through the corners and coming up on the \"40 MPH Speed Limit Sign\" which means that we are getting close to entering the Waynesville,  MO. city limits.  It was a winter night, about 7:00 pm and had been dark for about 2 hours .  We rounded a corner and were meeting a car--both of us had our headlights on -- and there in the middle of the road--standing right on the yellow line which separates the two lanes--is this \"thing.\"  It was about 7-8 feet tall and covered with hair.  It was almost \"frozen,\" much like a deer is when the headlights of a car hit it.  My husband was driving and he slammed on the breaks, as did the car that we had met.  At this time, we were just passed the creature, as was the other car.  But, both of us had stopped--and there standing on the yellow line of Hwy.17, and being illuminated by the tail lights of both vehicles--still stood this creature.  It stood there for about 30 seconds and then it sort of leaped off the roadway and into the Roubidoux Creek/Gasconade River.  At this time, I was extremely scared and was pleading with my husband to just \"GO!\"--so we took back off, as did the other car.  We continued on toward Waynesville and the other car continued on toward Crocker.  We did not get out to  investigate, and as far as I know, the other car didn't either. We had no weapons with us (just in case we would need them) and it was dark--and suddenly very eerie.  I have never heard of any  stories of this particular incident, so I assume that the other people who witnessed this had the same idea that we did--NEVER TELL A SOUL--we have discussed this with close friends and family,  but no one else--until now.  When I visited this web site and found out that there were acutally other sightings in the state of Missouri, I thought maybe there was some worth to telling about this night. (I forgot to add that it was drizzling that evening).",

  "location_details": "This occured on Hwy. 17 North of Waynesville, MO. (Pulaski County) almost exactly even with the \"40 MPH Speed Limit Sign\" When we got on up to the junction of Hwy 17 and Bus. 44, there was a residential structure fire and the Waynesville Fire Dept. was there. They had their water hoses ran across the intersection and had a metal ramp laid across the hoses, so that cars could drive over them. It was a very cold night and the water was running across the roadway and freezing. This made the intersection extremely slick. So, this information should be fairly easy to obtain.
