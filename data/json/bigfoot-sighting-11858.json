  "observed": "It was our annual summer camping trip and I was in the back of the car with my uncle.  My grandmother and grandfather were in the front and my grandma and uncle were sleeping.  I was staring out the side window and slightly forward.  While looking I saw a large animal that I thought was a bear.  It was only a very brief view but the animal was walking upright and was very furry.  I mentioned to my grandfather that I saw a \"huge bear\" walking upright but he laughed and said it must have been trying to climb a tree.  But there was a break in the trees where I saw the creature.  It looked like it was going off of the side of the road into the forest. I cannot be sure what it was.  But, it was so very odd that it certainly looked like it was \"walking\" on two legs.  It was dark so I couldn't distinguish any other features.",
