  "observed": "I saw [a] bigfoot about five years ago on the Kitsap Penninsula in Washington State.  I was between Kingston and Hansville. I was giving a friend of mine a ride home and it was very late at night. We had just past \"Kountry Kornor\" and as we approached what the locals call Maple Tree Cornor we saw a huge animal that neither of us could identify.  It was standing on one side of the road and as we approached, it started crossing to the other side.  It stopped for a moment and looked right at us.  It seemed to be a little stunned by the headlights. Then it ran across the street and jumped down a very steep ravine. There is a streetlight on that cornor so I was able to see it very clearly.  It appeared to be about six to seven feet tall.  It's hair was light in color...almost gray.  The hair hanging down from the underside of it's arms was very long. I know it sounds silly, but I had two very distinct impressions as I looked at this creature...that it was female and that it was sad. You know I take back what I said about not being able to identify it...the second I saw it I knew exactly what it was.  As we approached the spot where it had jumped into the woods I slowed down to see if it was still there.  The man that I was with was completely panicked...he yelled at me to speed up and get out of there.  He and I only talked about it once after that...he seemed to be completly unsettled by the experience.  I was more curious than afraid.  I did not get the impression we were in any danger.  I hope than one day I will see [a] bigfoot again.",
