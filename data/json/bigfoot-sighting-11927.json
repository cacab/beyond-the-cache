  "observed": "One day at about 3:00 p.m. my friend and I, Shaun, were out riding his four wheeler back in the woods.  We stopped and turned off the four- wheeler for about 20 minutes and went walking.  When we got back we were just about to turn on the four wheeler when we heard a call that sounded like some kind of primate call.  Then I remembered when I was watching the history channel about bigfoot and the people recorded a call from bigfoot and they played it and it sounded just like what I just heard.",
