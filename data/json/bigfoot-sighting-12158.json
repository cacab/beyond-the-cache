  "observed": "When I was 8 years old,while living in a forested portion of central Idaho, my little brother and I got up on a snowy February morning at dawn to watch cartoons. It was to early and only a test pattern was on the TV. We turned off the TV and my brother went back upstairs to bed. I opted to stay on the couch in my warm blankets and wait untill the cartoons started. The couch was positioned along an outside wall beneath a row of 3' wide x 5' tall picture windows. These windows were approximately  7 feet from the ground on the outside. The 19\" TV was sitting on top of a tall wood storage box next to the wood stove directly across from the couch. I could see the reflection of the windows in the darkened TV screen. I dozed off for a while and was awakened by a noise which I thought was the snow sliding off the metal roof. I noticed a shadow shape in the window reflection nearest the stairs and at first thought it was a snow bank created by the snow off the roof. Then I saw the shadow move on to the next window and then it stopped at the window just past the head of the couch. I listened and heard some movement outside and also a sort of grunting noise. My heart started to race as I watched the mirrored reflection in the TV screen. Curiosity got the better of me and I sat up on my knees on the couch, leaned over the armrest, and looked out the window. I will never forget what I saw! There, just a few feet away was a sasquatch peering in the window. It was scanning the room with obvious curiosity. After a couple of seconds it sensed my movement and looked directly into my eyes. The face looked like a gorilla but with longer hair and \"smarter eyes\". It was not like the dark black eyes you see on other forest animals. Terrified, I dove off the couch and scurried on my hands and knees toward the bottom of the staircase. I tried to call out for my mom but my voice didn't work. I was afraid the bigfoot would hear me. Finally, I gave out a few meager calls and my mom finally appeared on the balcony above the room. \"What's the matter?\" she said. \"There is a bigfoot outside.\" I whispered. At that point I started to cry and shake. Sensing that something had terrified me , she said,\"Well get up here then.\" I was still afraid to move. She said she couldn't see anything outsde from up there ,so I flew up the stairs using my hands and feet. My mom knew I wasn't joking around and she wouldn't let my brother and I outside to play in the snow untill later in the afternoon. My brother saw the holes in the snow where I thought the animal stood but snow had partially filled them and he wouldn't believe my story. Years later, a friend of my moms, who knew about my sighting, gave her an old local newspaper with a story in it about multiple bigfoot sightings occuring with in a 30 mile radius of home during that 1979 time period.",
