  "observed": "We were on a family hike in the Ventana Wilderness area, south West of the dam.  We had been climbing pretty steadily and were walking along a ridgeline, next to a densely forested downhill.  My sixteen year old son was leading, about 20 yds ahead.  I heard him let out a scream and immediately ran to see what was wrong. I heard a large animal crashing down the hill to my right and caught a glimpse of a dark object which quickly disappeared into the vegetation.  Note at this time, my son was about 74 inches and 190 lbs.  I turned to him and asked \"What was it?\"  His reply was \"I don't know.\"  He and I stood there and discussed it for a while.  As he was walking up the trail he heard a rushing sound like something running toward him.  He glanced to his right and saw an animal running directly toward him. At this point he screamed. In his words it was bigger than he was and ran right past him on two legs and proceeded down the hill.  As I said, I caught a fleeting glimpse of part of something dark. His description was of a bipedal creature, covered in hair clearly over 6 ft tall and weighing more than 190 lbs.",
