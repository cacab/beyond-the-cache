  "observed": "I was getting ready for work one morning in the late spring of 2004.  I walked out of my bathroom and there is a window in my bedroom, directly outside of my bathroom door.  I thought I saw something peripherally and turned to look and see what wildlife might be outside my home this day (my backyard is completely wooded).  I gasped and RAN back into the bathroom. What I saw when I looked out the window was no further than four feet from the back of my house and striding by the window when I looked.  Whatever it was stood about 7 feet tall and was covered in brown hair.  It was moving very quickly and was walking on two \"feet\".  I don't know if it saw me, but I saw it. I stood in my bathroom for about a minute trying to gather my thoughts and I peeked out.  At this point, I saw nothing.  I'll be honest, for the past year I've tried convincing myself that there was a bear outside and that I couldn't possibly have seen what I did see.  I do remember specifically saying for the next two weeks (around the house to my significant other and my daughter only) that [a] bigfoot lived in our backyard.",
