  "observed": "My encounter was back in 1982. A friend and I were visiting a neighbor lady and were leaving to go home around 10pm. We had ridden our bikes there. We were pushing the bikes up the steep driveway to the main road when we seen a huge sihouette walk across the driveway opening at the main road. We had both seen it and said, \"Did you see that?\" It walked back the other direction, crossing the driveway entrance again. I said, \"There it goes again! What the heck was that?\" It reappeared and stopped at the top of the driveway and was looking directly at us. I said, \"There it is!\", and it grunted at us. We were scared. We dropped our bikes and ran back to the lady's house as fast as we could.. We told her what we saw. She laughed and grabbed a flash light and took us outside. We really did not want to go back out, but we trusted her. We walked back up the driveway with the lady shinning the flash light everywhere. Nothing. Our bikes still laying where we had seen it.  We picked up our bikes. She walked us to the top of the driveway and shined the flashlight in both directions on the road. We took off riding as fast as we could to get home, about a mile away. We told our parents. And, of course, they said it was a deer or a bear mating or something ... They made jokes about it ...",
