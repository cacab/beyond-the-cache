  "observed": "While walking along the Mill Creek Constitutional Path on 12/15/2000 witness Harley Michaelis observed large barefooted tracks along the trail.  Harley estimated the tracks to be 18-20 inches long and 9-10 inches wide, he also noticed a smaller set of tracks along with the other tracks.  Harley said the second set of tracks were about 10 inches long.  As he followed the tracks he came to a wooden bridge and lost the tracks there.  Harley did not report this sighting till 14 days later out of fear that he would be considered a nut.",
