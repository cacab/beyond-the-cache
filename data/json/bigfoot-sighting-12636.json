  "observed": "I did not directly see this incident.  I don't even know if this IS a sighting!  We were on our way to Alaska in 2003 and went via Glacier National Park.  I had a video camera that I was recording on and took more videos than photos.  Only months after we got back home and I got around to looking at the tapes, did I see this figure in the video.  I wish I had seen it while I was filming.",

I know this bridge was a little way after the first big lake (Lake McDonald). One could walk down in to the park and one had to walk down a narrow little dirt path to get to the bridge that went over the river which is on the left side of the road.",
