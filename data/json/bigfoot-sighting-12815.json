  "observed": "My wife and I were returning home from a quick trip to the store. It was dark, about 10pm.  We live in a rural area, in Blaine, TN.  As we rounded a turn, almost to our house, my headlights caught the eyes of what I thought was an animal.  Then I noticed as we got closer that it was standing on two legs and was furry all over. It hopped a road-side barbed wire fence and disappeared into the night.  I stopped immediately, just past where it had jumped the fence.  I asked my wife if she saw it, but she was trying to get something out of the floor board. I got out but stayed by the vehicle, and looked out into the field but couldn't see anything.  I do remember that its eyes caught light like an animals eyes, but I know from the shape and the way it jumped over the fence using its arms to lower the top wire that it was not a bear. The terrain was hilly area with wooded ridges and fields, and a river about 1/2 mile or so from the sighting area.  This occured in early April 2005.",
