  "observed": "I was looking to the south from the summit of Silver Star Mountain. On the ridge across from me I saw something I thought looked a little strange. I got out my camera and took some pictures. Right after I took the first shot it moved or stood up so I took another picture. It then moved towards the south, away from me. I then had to reajust because the wind was so strong. It was difficult to move  because the snow was waist deep. I got closer to a rock to steady myself and took another picture.  It was then was moving down the hill. I don't think it was another backpacker or snowshoer.",
