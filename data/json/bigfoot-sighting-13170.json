  "observed": "For years our neighbors would tell us that there was a bigfoot that roamed the woods where we lived. We thought that it was a way to keep us from wondering off and finding the illegal plants they may have been growing. The only reason we somewhat believed them was, the grandmother who told us the same thing was a minister at a local church. She is no longer with us. The day i saw what i believe to be a bigfoot was a summer day around 7:45 to 8:30ish. My sister and i was going to visit our friends. She was driving. We travel this route all the time. During the school year the bus travels this route also. The reason i say this is to let you know, im familiar with the area. As we aproached the small brige that crosses a pond that we call a swamp we both noticed it in the middle of the road. At first i thought it was a bear. As she slowed the car and hit the horn; it stood up looked in our direction and took off across the swamp. I have seen many bears, twice too close for comfort. I had one to stand up in front me in my grandmas back yard. I think it was spooked as much as i was. We both ran. It ran away on four legs. So i know what i saw was not a bear. I remember being amazed watching this thing run off.I asked my sister to turn around and go back. She locked the doors and turned around. When we got back there was something in the road that it must have been eating. A rabbit,opossum some type of small animal. Probably road kill. It was dark brown at least 6 to 7 foot tall. It happened so quick, i was not able to get a good look at the face. All i remember was it was big, harry, large back with no neck. I was 16 yaers old at the time, my sister was 18. No one believed us. Not even our neighbors. I am now 34. I can still see the image in my head. What made me recall this, was the footage; where the men on horses record it walking away. Seeing that thing walking back into the woods looking at the large back and the muscle, man!",
