  "observed": "I am a Civil War re-enactor and I was participating in an event on the grounds of Hildene Mansion, which is Robert Todd Lincoln's home near Manchester, Vermont.  We were camped on the front lawn of the mansion, which is bordered on two sides by woods.  The whole area is somewhat off the beaten path, the house is probably a half mile from the main road. In the middle of Friday night, I would guess around 1-2 a.m., I woke up and was walking to the building beside the main house to use the rest room, and as I left my tent and was walking toward the restroom I heard footsteps walking near me in the woods.  They seemed to follow me as I went to the rest room and as I walked back from the rest room they walked back with me to my tent. The whole time walking back I had an uneasy feeling like I was being watched. The next night, Saturday, I was sitting around the campfire around 11:00 pm talking and we heard footsteps coming from the woods which we were right next to, but the noises were coming from inside the woods.  We shined a flashlight on the area that the noise was coming from and it stopped immediatly and as we turned the flashlight off we heard the noises again heading away from us. Both times that I heard the noise it sounded like a large animal and from what I could hear it sounded like a large animal walking on two feet.  While there were other groups at the event I don't think that it was another person as there were trails that were clear that they could have used. Also of course it was so late at night and there was no light from a lantern or a flashlight.",
