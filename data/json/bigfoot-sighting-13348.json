  "observed": "This sighting happened over 1 year ago. I happened upon your site recently, although I did write to George Noory about the sighting 10 months ago. I am a truck driver. I was headed north on US Route 69. Another truck was passing me and his cab was just about 5 feet from the front of my truck. Off to my right I saw a something running towards the road. The other truck locked up his breakes and I slowed down to keep from hitting it. It took only 2 steps to cross both lanes of the highway, went down the median and crossed the southbound lanes. It ran upright and held its arms to its side as opposed to having its elbows bent like a man would . Its hands where down to its knees. It was covered with dark hair I'd guess about 6 or 7 in long. The \"thing\" glanced our way as it ran and seem to have dark or black eyes. It was taking long strides and was slightly bent at the waist. The hair on its legs seemed to be longer the the rest of it's hair. I say hair and fur as it flowed as it ran. It was able to look straight into my cab so I would estimate it was between 7 and 9 ft tall.",
