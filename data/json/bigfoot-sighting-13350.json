I always carry a chair to sit in, was sitting for about 35 minutes when I seen a very large man walking though the woods at 1st look. At my 2nd hard look I was looking to see the background to gauge the size of this person. the thing I notice was it was very black ,had no hunter's orange on.{ in the Nat. Forest you must wear an orange vest and hat}it was white from the ground up on each leg about 12\" to 20\" up both legs. It was about 60 to 80 yards from me only seen it take about 8 or 9 step's in open woods, it walked behind a falling tree was going to rise my gun to get a better look when it came in to the next opening. It never came out of the brush.
