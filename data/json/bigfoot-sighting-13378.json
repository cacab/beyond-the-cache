  "observed": "I haven't told many people about my experience because of alot of non-believers.The year was 1976, I was 15 years old. Snow was on the ground and a couple of friends and myself were snow sledding on my Dads farm. It was around 7:30 that night. We had a fire built at the bottom of the hill. We had just slid down the hill and were making our way back up the hill when we heard something making alot of noise and commotion to the right of us out beyond the light of the fire. We didn't stay around long enough to see what it was. I ran hard as I could to the house and told my parents about what we had heard. We went back to the hill the next day to see if we could find anything. When we saw the tracks in the snow we knew what was there at the bottom of the hill that night. The tracks were at least 18 inches long and 5 or 6 inches wide. No doubt in my mind what was there that night watching us.The tracks came from out of the woods that were near by and when it left, it went back in the woods the same way that it came. We didn't actually see the creature that night but we heard it and saw the tracks. That was almost 30 years ago and haven't seen or heard anything since.",
