  "observed": "At about 5pm January 5, 2006, I was returning home from a trip to Florence Alabama via the Natchez Trace Parkway. About fifty yards north of mile marker 307, a creature darted across the road between my car and another coming the opposite way. It was solid black and looked to be between 4 1/2 feet tall and 5 feet tall and was running on 2 legs. I could not clearly make out any features in part because it was near sunset and in part because of the speed at which it ran. It appeared to running alongside the road heading down the southbound lane and very quickly turned and crossed the road. It stumbled slightly at the edge of the road and swung its arms to regain balance then continued across the road and into the tree line. I don't care to speculate how fast it was moving but I'm sure it was faster than a human, maybe about as fast as a deer can run. I stopped when I got to where it crossed but I did not see anything else. My wife who was with me did not spot it and if the people in the oncoming car spotted it, they made no indication.",
