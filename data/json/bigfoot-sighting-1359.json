  "observed": "The creature was seen during mid fall snow storm from the east bound lane of Highway 24. Traffic was backed up due to snow and ice on the highway bringing traffic to a standstill after stepping out of the vehicle we saw a woman pointing up onto the hillside. We observed the creature about two hundred feet above the highway on a ridge-line ofver looking the road. Due to the snow and ice and the fear of everyone around we were not able to follow the creature. To this day I have talked to about 35 people in the front range area who have also had sightings of the creature",
