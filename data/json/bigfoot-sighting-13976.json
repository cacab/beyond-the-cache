  "observed": "After reading your reports from Florida's Lake County I must put down something that happend to me as a child. We had been staying near Lady Lake close to the Griffin Chain of Lakes. We were staying with my grandparents in early 80 or 81. It was late in the evening and everyone was in bed. I had a room on the front of the house by myself. I hear a noise outside my window and we too scared to look. I was about 10 or 11. There were many different sounds, from growling and snorting to footsteps. Again I didn't look and stayed in bed awake for a couple of hours. The noises only last about 5-10 minutes. I went outside as soon as I woke up in the morning and found an intersting item. My brother and I had piled up sand in the dirt driveway the day before. This morning there were 2 large footprints in the sand pile.  I showed the tracks to my family and they all played it off as a fluke or a neighborhood kid goofing off. I can't think of too many kids with feet that big. I measured them with a tape and they were about 17\" long and 8-10\" acrossed. I do believe stronger today that this was a bigfoot. We were very close to an old saw mill and very close to forest and lake areas that had some secluded areas.",
