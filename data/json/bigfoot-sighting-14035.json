  "observed": "My family owns a home on Chazy Lake in the northeast corner of the Adirondacks.  I spend many weekends there and often wake up early on Monday morning in order to get into work (about 1 hour away).  In February of 2005, I had gotten up and left the house at about 6:30 am.  Approximately 2 miles down the Chazy Lake Road, headed toward the Town of Saranac, is where I had my sighting. A ditch (approximately 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep)runs along side of the road.  There was probably a foot of snow on the ground.  As I was driving, I saw something dark stand up from inside the ditch and head into the woods.  When I saw it, it was probably 150-200 yards in front of me.  It appeared to have a human shape but was slouched over.  I could not tell the height nor could I give an approximate weight.  The sighting lasted probably no more than 5 seconds.  I saw the upper 2/3 of its body which appeared to be dark brown or black in color.  I told my wife about it that night and we joked about it for a bit saying it must have been Bigfoot.  In all honesty, I thought I had either seen or bear or my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I hadn't thought about the sighting for quite some time until I read about a sighting in Clinton County (1998) on this web page and noticed it was in almost the exact same location as my sighting.",
