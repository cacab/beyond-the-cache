  "observed": "In July of 1985 on a hot but clear afternoon I was driving home on County Rd. 21 about 1 mile from my home when up ahead I saw these dark figures approach the side of the road.  They were standing there in close proximity to each other and as I neared them, all the while slowing down my speed, I could see three distinct and different sized figures. I've lived in the country all my life.  I grew up playing and hiking the whole countryside and I knew the area around my home real well.  I have always loved watching animals in the woods but I did not know what to make of these creatures.  As I neared them, they appeared to be of various heights, about 2 feet or more, 3 feet and maybe 5 feet or more and all had brown black thick looking shaggy hair all over.  I could not see any facial features but they're arms were long for their bodies. They appeared to hesitate as though they couldn't decide what to do as I approached them in my car.  All of a sudden they ran across the road in front of me and vanished into the thick bushes and trees on the other side of the road. They did not stoop over but ran upright and with swiftness.  I was stunned.  They were no animal I had ever encountered before.  I started to slow down and get out of my car, but all of a sudden it hit me.  I've seen something that can't be explained other than these creatures are not normal creatures.  I was spooked and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.  I quickly gassed the car and sped home and told my encounters with these creatures to my husband and sons.  I will never forget this.  I know what I saw and it will always be with me.",
