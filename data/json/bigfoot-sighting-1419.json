  "observed": "My husband, myself and my husbands friend were walking on a narrow trail to Salt Creek Falls near Talladega National Forest. I stopped on the trail when I smelled a foul smell. We did not see or hear anything at this time. We walked down to the falls the water was very low so we walked out onto the large rocks to sit, we sat talking for about 30 min. I heard a sound like trees moving then I heard nothing else so we were on our way out when we saw a very large footprint in the sandy creek bank. It was approx. 18 inches long and about 7 inches wide it had very pronounced toe prints.",
