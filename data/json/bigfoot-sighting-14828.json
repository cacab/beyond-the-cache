  "observed": "My husband and I had just been over to a friends house to purchase a car.  On the way home we were driving south on M-156 at about dusk.  Our son was in the vehicle but he was lying down in the back seat.  When we reached a set of guardrails something suddenly appeared directly in front of us.  It was tall and dark.  It then disappeared off to the east. My husband had stopped the car and we both just looked at each other in amazement.  We didn't know how we hadn't hit this thing since it was so close to us.  It disappeared very fast.  There was a car coming from the other direction that was quite a ways away that stopped. Unfortunately there is not much we can describe about this thing.  It was tall, dark, two-legged, and moved very fast. We were both so shook up at the time we didn't investigate more on the scene which we've always regretted.  We didn't talk with the person in the other vehicle although there's a chance he was a caller to a radio station that I've described below.",
