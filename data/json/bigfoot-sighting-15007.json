  "observed": "It was in 2004. I told my husband at the time I saw sasquach (not sure if I am spelling it right). He laughed and said I was nuts, so I really never brought it up again until.... 2 days ago I saw on the news reported sighting of a bigfoot in Central IL. I did not come face to face with him thank God. I caught him running. I could see his backside big tall and hairy, very hairy.  I was at my home on the Fulton - McDonough County line.  We lived near Vermont Lake easy walking distance down a gravel road right off Elk Road. I was outside doing my chores feeding the horses. We lived near forests all around all sides (Vermont Lake as our backyard).  We lived atop a small hill slope with a gully running all around. I saw him come out of the woods to the west and run very fast through our pasture and back into the woods. I saw him jump the creek which seemed to me impossible, too far, but he did and ran up the hill back north and he was gone.  I have never seen him again.",
