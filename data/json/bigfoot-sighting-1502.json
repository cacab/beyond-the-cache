  "observed": "I was in the woods walking around and turning to the deeper recesses of the forest, I saw a rather tall figure coming toward me on two legs. It was hard to discern at first what it's appearance was but as it got closer, I noticed it was covered from head to toe with a thick coat of dark hair.  Needless to say, I didn't stick around to find out what it wanted.  I turned and ran until I got to the neighborhood and into the comforting environment of my house.",
