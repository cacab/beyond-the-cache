  "observed": "Driving down S. 75 with my family and brother in law in seperate trucks going through Tennessee to Georgia. The road was 2 lanes and N. bound lane seemed to be 200 yds. away from us. With my bright lights on and in left lane I noticed a very large object on the left side of road. As we got closer to what I thought was a bear, turned out to be a bigfoot. When we got to within 75 yds. I could see it crouched over a dead animal. As we were about to pass it, it turned and looked right at us. I freaked out and called carl on the phone to ask him \" did u see what I just did\" ? He did. Been very scared to tell anyone, cause people will think we are nuts. We know what we saw.",
