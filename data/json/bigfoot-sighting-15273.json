  "observed": "I grew up in Boulder County, my parents quit farming in NE and moved to Longmont in 1960. During the summer, we would go up Big Thompson Canyon or the St. Vrain to camp and picnic. In the summer of 1964, we were picnicking along the St. Vrain stream. We had started a campfire, you could do that then, and while I was looking for wood, I felt like I was being stared at. I looked up, and at the top of a sheer rock wall about thirty feet up, I saw him. I can see him like yesterday. He was looking at me and as soon as I saw him he turned and left. He was very large probably eight feet tall and had long greying hair. His face was darker and did almost look human. No one believed me of course, but I can still see his eyes looking at me before he turned. So I have always believed in their existence.",
