  "observed": "We( me and a friend ) went night fishing for catfish , actually getting to a muddy   run-off right off st rd 41 around 10pm during the summer of 1997 near turner road. As we off loaded our equipment and cleared the overpass rails we headed down the side of the overpass; we were shining flashlights around the pond  to make sure we didn't step on any snakes or gators, something screamed at us (now mind you that there was only about 2 to 3 feet of space between the pond and dense woods i can't imagine how something can even get in there)  with such intensity that i felt my chest rattle my heart almost stopped; it felt like whatever this was was right in front of us and it did not want us there!! we are not  amateurs we both were carrying high powered hand guns  and could not locate what this creature was or where it was yet it felt like it was right in front of us. we scanned the area over and over but to our surpised could not locate where or what this sound came from all we knew was that it was BIG!! well we hightailed it out of there and could never understand what could have that kind of vocal power until i started my own research online. Me and my friend have been fishing in the glades for over 25 years and have much experience  with wildlife , bors gators, deers black bear, i've even seen panthers and have done a some tracking, i have found footprints that just don't add up; bare human shaped prints in the middle of a cypress swamp, i've seen what looked like a urangutan in the swamp looking at us from behind trees and disappearing and me my friend would always ( this type of sighting twice), jokingly state that someone's pet had gotten away.  we never been bothered other then that night this creature screamed at us and we took it as it did'n't wan't us there i felt we disturbed something, invaded it's territory, i hope this helps for after i started my own research i came to the conclusion that these creatures do exist call it what you want (bigfoot, skunkape, sasquatch) they are real and they don't bother us except when we invade their space . I really enjoy your website it also helps me understand that i'm  not crazy , most people would  think and look at me like i'm crazy  when i relatemy encounter, (they don't have any experience outside of the city, they will never understand until  bigfoot hits them over the head, even then they'd deny it. These creatures have a right to be there good luck",
