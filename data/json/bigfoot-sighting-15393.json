  "observed": "On Friday, July 28th- my 15 year old son was visiting his grandparents on the Lake of Egypt in Marion, Illinois. After dark he remembered that he didn't take the battery off the charger on the bass boat so he headed down the hill toward the dock. Since it was very dark, he brought along his 10 million candlepower spot light. He went down to the lake and started taking the charger off the battery. He decided to shine his light on the other side of the cove to look for raccoons or turtles or coyotes or deer, whatever he might be able to see. He looked to a point off the cove and noticed a big black figure or \"glob\" in the 6 or 7 foot tall grass. He realized it was not something that he had seen during his visit while fishing (for 2 weeks prior). He flashed his flashlight on and off to get it's attention so it would look at him. He wanted to see what kind of eyes it had. He whistled to get it's attention - and put the light back on and heard a different whistle back. My son looked up top of the hill toward the house to see if his grandparents were playing a trick on him and no one was there. So he instantly flashed back to the spot where the creature was standing. He saw it starting to move away and he noticed the tops of the weeds moving as it left. He was creeped out and ran back up to the house- because it was to big for a deer or coyote.",
