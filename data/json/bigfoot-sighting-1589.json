  "observed": "My partner and I were hunting the late deer hunt in Nov. We were hunting a blowdown area near a large stand of old growth timber. When we came up on some very large tracks not bear and not human. My partner and I both have been hunters and woodsman since we could barley walk. Neither of us had ever seen tracks like these. The strangest part was the woods became very silent, no birds nothing I looked at my partner and said I know something is watching us I got the same feeling I would get in VietNam. We never saw what made the track but we left the area very hastily.",
