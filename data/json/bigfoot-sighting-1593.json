  "observed": "I was eight years old and playing in the woods with some friends. I accidently got separated from my friends and got lost in the woods. While walking down a trail I got the feeling that I wasn't alone. At first, I thought it was my friends playing tricks on me so I just coninued down the trail. A few minutes later I hit an odor that to this day I cannot describe, and I heard what sounded like something was growling at me. The growl or whatever it was, was coming from my left in some thick bushes. I thought that I come to close to an animal that was eating some other animal, so I began to walk much faster. That's when I heard the scream. The scream seemed to surround me so I can only guess that it came from those bushes. I ran out of the woods as fast as I could. I never looked back so I don't know if whatever it was was following me. I never told anyone about it until my mother and I watched a documentary recently and I heard a recording of what was supposed to be a Bigfoot growling or mumbling. It was the same noise I heard that day. I can't say for sure that I was that close to a Bigfoot but it sounded just like that recording I heard on TV.",
