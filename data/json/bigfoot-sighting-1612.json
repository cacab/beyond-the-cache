  "observed": "I'd just like to state that I'm not the witness, I'm making this report out on her behalf. There was a huge crashing through underbrush. She described it as a very rappid thrashing/crashing sound, twigs snapping, etc. It was followed by a loud, high pitched scream. She likened it to a woman screaming. She said it was very close, based on the distance she pointed out to me, maybe about 30-50 yards. She said she and the four other people she was camping with her absolutely terrified and left the area right away.",
