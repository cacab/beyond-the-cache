  "observed": "My husband and I had been cutting firewood just off a mountain road. I was busy cutting off knots from the already cut chunks of wood and my husband was running the noisy chainsaw. Over the noise of the chainsaw I heard a loud snap (brush) and looked over in the direction it came from and saw nothing.  I had seen cattle in the area just prior to that but they all ran off when the chainsaw started.  No cattle in sight.  About an hour later I went over to the pickup truck to get a drink of water and started hearing noises I've not heard in the mountains before.  I was raised deep in the mountains so am very familiar with forest sounds. On the other side of the roadway is a heavily wooded and deep canyon.  From that direction I heard a \"knocking\" sound.  Not a woodpecker as this was slow and not too loud.  Then I heard a soft whistle and what sounded like a parrot or mynah bird when it's trying to learn to talk.  Just kind of \"gibberish\", then the knocking and the soft whistle.  Again, I've heard all kinds of sounds in the mountains, having been raised there, but nothing like this.  I walked across the roadway and looked down into the trees, but saw nothing.  We returned to the same spot the next day and there was no repeat of this.",
