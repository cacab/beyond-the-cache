  "observed": "My mother (T.G.) and my aunt and my two uncles were driving over Emigrant Pass by Pendleton OR when they decided to stop and stretch their legs.  When they got out one of my uncles who is blind had smelled a very unusual smell very foul. He notified my mom, aunt and uncle. They looked over the cliff into the canyon below. What they saw was what at first they thought was a bear but when it stood up and walked away they knew it was something else. From what my mom told me it was drinking from a stream with it's hands. It had long brown hair and looked like a bear. but when it got up and started walking it looked like a tall human-grizzly. Since there are no grizzly bear in northeast OR they had no explanation as to what it was. It walked in a simi-crouched position and had to have been at least 7 feet tall. Before it went into the forest it turned all the way around to look up at my mom and everyone else and then whent into the forest.",
