  "observed": "It was a warm May evening. Three High School friends and myself went up to Split Rock Resevoir one Friday night to hang out. We pulled off to a small parking area just south of the resevoir dam. We all got out of the car and as we were sitting around the car just talking, we all heard a loud sound, like a howl. Then we heard some large noises like something was shaking or moving branches. We all looked at each other and jumped back in the car as quickly as we possibly could and drove off. Until recently, I hadn't given this incident much thought, but after reading some of the accounts listed on this website from this area of NJ, I have become aware that this could have been a similar creature described in these other documented accounts.",
