  "observed": "I heard the same sounds described in the Aug 2006 report at Bear Lake.  I was camping at Spillway Campground located in Apache-Sitgreaves.  This is located close to Woods Canyon Lake. Our actual campsite was about 50 yards from the lake itself. I'm familiar with the sounds of the local wildlife, including elk and owl, and I'm fairly certain the sound was not made by these animals. These vocalizations sounded angry as well and lasted for approximately 10 minutes.",
