  "observed": "At about 9:30 at night, I was back in an area Near Lake Asbury where there is a Church camp in the woods. It was dark, but there was enough light to see what I saw. It was about 8' tall, and was running straight across from me about 50' away. It was covered with black, shaggy hair. Its head was kind of dome-like, and its shoulders were very big. It appeared to be trotting, and its shoulders twisted back and forth as it ran, but its arms hung straight down at its sides, not pumping back and forth like a human's would. Its arms hung down nearly to its knees. I saw it and watched it for about 7 seconds. I started shaking, because we had talked about this creature in class, and I immediately knew what I had seen. About a minute later, I smelled this horrible smell that smelled like a wet, nasty pig pen after a rain (we have pigs so I'm sure of the smell). About 5 minutes later I heard some hooting noises. They were quite loud, and there were about 3 hoots one after another, then a pause of about 2 seconds, then about 3-4 more hoots. It sounded similar to some of the Bigfoot sounds, hoots, we listened to in my Biology class, but they were longer.",
