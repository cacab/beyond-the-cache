  "observed": "I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research, and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area, decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot. After walking thirty to forty minutes down the main trail beginning from Great Neck Road, I took a smaller path off of the trail for about five minutes. That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground. More noteworthy, however, was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that, I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence, but I figured it was worth telling experts, who could then take it as far as they saw fit.",
