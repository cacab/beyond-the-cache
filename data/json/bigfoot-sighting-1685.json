  "observed": "We are skydivers, in August 1996 in  Kapowsin Washington we were at the annual Skydive boogie called \"Geek Brothers\". Some of our friends flew there Cessna to the drop zone, and over Mnt. Rainer walking down a road was a Sasquash. They whipped the plane around and buzzed it at about 100'. Totaly amazing they said watching it take off running down the road with huge strides, then as the plane got almost over the top it leeped off the road running uphill jumping stumps like nothing, they spun around for another look and it was gone.",
