  "observed": "My mother and I were en route to Mobile,AL from Boothville, LA. It was approximately 2 A.m. We left Interstate 10 travelling north towards the Dawes community where my mother grew up and most of our family still reside.  We crossed the smaller of two bridges in close proximity to one another when we saw what we first thought must be a VERY large dog sitting in the opposite lane of the road. As we approached we saw the creature was sitting on haunches as a dog would but was face to face with us in the car ( an 80's model pontiac parisienne). It showed no fear and did not so much as budge as we passed it, it did turn it's head and watch us as we drove by. Unlike a dog the creature had a human like face that was the only part of its body not covered in long reddish brown hair. Even seated on its haunches the creature was about the height of an average man. It was more slender in build than the average \"Bigfoot\" we have seen portrayed in reports of sightings in the northern part of the US.  We don't want to say this was a bigfoot but after watching a special on the history channel my mother and I agree that the similarities are enough to contact you and see what you think. We would like to add that local legends about the \"Grand Bay Wolfman\" are numerous and we heard stories about the \" hairy  man monster \" that likes to sit on bridges at night our entire lives, but up until we saw this thing for ourselves we never took them seriously.",
