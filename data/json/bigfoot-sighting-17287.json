  "observed": "I was driving home from college for a weekend visit with my family.  It was dark, probably around 7 or 8 o'clock.  I hadn't seen any other cars on the road for quite a while. I was about halfway thru Circleville Canyon when just at the edge of my headlights I saw something big on the edge of the road.  I started to slow down, didn't want to hit it should it run in front of me.  But as I got closer it stood up & I thought for a second it was a person.  Then it started running.  It ran across the road approx 70 feet in front of my car.  My heart was pounding.  It was huge & hairy with long arms.  It ran sort of bent over, but very quickly.  But not human like, as it didn't bounce.  It disappeared into the dark on the other side of the Hwy.  I was far to scared to stop & see if there were any tracks or anything.",
