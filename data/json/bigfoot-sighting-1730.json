  "observed": "With friend Scott Piveral, at about 7:30 AM on way to school, saw two white creatures that smelled like skunks, just standing at edge of woods on a hill, they then meanered back into woods. The creatures stood under a treelimb later measured as being 15' high and so could estimate that they were half that height. They made out that they were human like in basic shape. In the area they found 3 nests. They were on a slight hill with a flat spot. The upper hill side had 12' brush that was bent and broken over the flat area, leaving a 6' H x 8' W area beneath.",
