  "observed": "There were anywhere from 25 - 50 all over in the wet sand. All but one were about the size of my boots (size 10 women's) but at least 1/2 again as wide. I'll send you photos as soon as they are processed, but in the meantime I'll describe them as best I can. They have 5 toes, no arch, and a wide heel. They are about 1\" - 1 1/2\" deep in packed, hard sand. There are two different sets of prints, at least as far as I can tell. One is deformed and has a smaller heel, but still not thin enough to be that of a human (in my opinion). There's a large lump like bunion or something on the side of each foot in some of the prints but not others. J. and I got quite a few pictures of these prints (both sets) and one other print that we found heading up the cliff. It was about twice as big as all the others but nor nearly as clear. This was my first attempt at shutter-buggery since I was 10 so they may not be the best. They may not even come out at all! It remains to be seen. I'm also going to cast one or more of the prints if I can manage it. If I do, I'll be sure to send them down, packed well!",
