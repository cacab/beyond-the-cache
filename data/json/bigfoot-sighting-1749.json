  "observed": "My first husband and I were visiting a friends of his who lived on the west side of Mt. Baker, near Bellingham, Washington.  At about 3:00 pm all three of us were talking on the front porch when Vic (the friend) suddenly stiffened and stared looking very intently up at a nearby foothill, and called our attention to something \"funny\" moving around up there. Jim (my then husband) Vic and I watched two taller and one smaller brownish creatures move back and forth for about ten miniutes. Then Vic suggested we go take a closer look. The spot was along an exposed streach of an old logging road (which abound in the region). We went up, only to find whatever it was gone. There were a lot of branches piled in a heap that for some reason suggested a bed, but nothing else. Some of the branches had been freshly torn off trees at least 10 feet off the ground, and arranged in a loafish shape. I don't know if this was a sasquach, but there were no claw marks or bear prints around, and the branches were torn off too high for a man to have done it without tools.",
