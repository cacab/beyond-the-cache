  "observed": "About three years ago me and a buddy of mine went scouting in the Goathee State forest off of highway 336/337 like we do almost every other day. Seeing that his house line was aganist the forest. That morning we decided to go further back than usuall, to try and find new deer trails or run up on a family of hogs. We were about three miles back and we started smelling something that I can only explain as being a dead carcuss mixed with a skunk. We have always been interested in Bigfoot, so I knew that it stinks but didnt think it was in central florida. Although there has been sightings in the ocala national forest. We keeped walking and came up on an old logging or ranger trail, it was covered with overgrown grass and had branches all over it. The road had palmettos lining it with a creek or runoff ditch on one side. We started walking down the trail towards our house. We were still about 2 3/4 mile from 337 when we came up on a bend in the trail. We walked around slowly to try and see deer or maybe some hogs on the trail, knowing that there are a couple herds in the area. There was nothing so we keeped walking. I told my friend to stop walking because I thought I saw something standing about 150yds down. I pointed at what I saw and we couldnt figure it out. He told me it was probably a tree, seeing that the had spray painted the trees to get them cut down. We keep walking and then it moved quite quickly toward the side of the trail, by then I was really nervous. We watched it from about 100yds away. It stayed on the left side of the trail neeling in some palmettos just staring at us. After about 10 minutes we were able to slowly get down in the creek out of the road but makeing sure it was still visible. After about 15 minutes of us staring at it, not believing that we actually are seeing a bigfoot it got up and walked back across the trail being followed by a smaller less intimidating one. The smaller one was not as dark as the bigger and had more of a redish color to it. they went out of sight when they crossed the creek into a densely cover underbrush. We found two footprints but no other signs of them. The bigger one was a dark brown with a hint of red in the sunlight. With lighter chest. Not really any hair on his face. We mesure the hight of them by what they walked by and the larger one was around 7 1/2-9 foot tall and the smaller was around 6-7 foot tall. I took my shoe off and put my foot in the print, I wear a size 11 1/2 shoe and the print was larger than my foot.",
