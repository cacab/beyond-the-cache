  "observed": "During the spring of 2000, my Mom and her friend were going to town, it was in the evening when we saw it. As my Mom left she reminded me to lock up, so I went to the door to lock it. As I locked the door, I watched my Mom and her friend drive past throught the window on the left side of my door. When I looked out side I noticed the outline of a pair of legs strolling through my neighbors yard. My first thought was that someone wearing adidas pants was going through my neighbor's yard and that some on must be snooping around. Being the nosy person that I am, I cupped my hands on the glass to get a better look. When I did, I saw a large dark redish brown brown figure with long stringy hair, About 8.5' tall. It seemed so musclular and it's legs did not straighten but remained bent. As it walked it swayed it's arms back and forth as I watched in amazement. When I realized it it was something out of the ordinary I panicked and jumped back behind the door. When I looked back it was gone, Moments later the phone rang, it was my Mom on her cellular phone. She sounded very startled when I answered it and automatically ordered me to make sure the dog was in and all the doors and windows locked because she had just seen something very weird. On hearing this I was relieved that I wasn't losing my mind. She said they were almost to the end of my street when a large animal with long reddish brown hair crossed the road in front of them and took one easy step over my neighbors barbed wire fence (mom clarified it was a metal gate) and kept going.  In interviewing the mom, she explained to me that she might have seen the sasquatch Chris was looking at if she had looked to the left into her neighbors yard as she drove by. But, her and her girl friend were distracted looking down the street at a very large man standing next to a 6' 6\" street sign. The top of the sign came about mid chest level. It stood still like it was hiding behind the sign. When they got closer to it, it bolted, taking two steps to clear the road and striding down her neighbors driveway and stepped over the metal 4' gate in one easy step. She said \"the long reddish brown hair swung back and forth as it swung it's arms. Moved very quickly, having a smooth and graceful gait.\" Also, she has seen his eyes glowing in the head lights of her car coming home at night. \"There have been time where I believe it has watched me at night when I have stayed up late working on paperwork in the dining room\". Her girl friend and her have been on the porch at night and heard it screaming and wailing over in the Duck Pond area.",
