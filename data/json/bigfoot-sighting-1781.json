  "observed": "R. and I had been fishing all day at the Duck Ponds. It started to get dark and we were walking out. We heard splashing in the big pond to the west of the gravel road and went to check it out. On the far southwest corner in the water up to it's chest was a sasquatch slapping the water. The water is way over my head at the place were it was. The size of him and depth of the water clearly indicated it was not human but something much larger. R. and I ran to a near by friends house and told them what we had just seen.",
