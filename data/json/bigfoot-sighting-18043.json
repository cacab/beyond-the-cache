  "observed": "A LONG STORY HERE. IT IS NOW MARCH 3, 2007.  I LIVE IN GUNTERSVILLE ALABAMA. I HAVE SPOKE TO SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES JUST AS CONVERSATION. THE STORY IS THIS.  ABOUT 15YRS AGO, MY WIFE, AND TWO CHILDREN WERE LEAVING OUR HOME IN HONEYCOMB, JUST NORTH OF GUNTERSVILLE OFF OF HWY. 431 AT THE BOTTOM OF GRANT ALABAMA. WE WERE IN ROUTE TO WAL-MART. ABOUT 8-9PM PROBABLY MID SUMMER. A WELL LIT SEEMS FULL MOON NIGHT. WE LIVED 4MI. AROUND PAST THE LAKE IN HONEYCOMB. I WAS DRIVING MY OLD HOT-ROD A 1964 FORD. THERE ARE SOME PERSONS BY THE LAST NAME OF (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) WHO ALWAYS HAVE DOGS IN THE STREET AT THEIR HOUSE BY THE LAKE. THE ROAD WHITE ELEPHANT RD. RUN BY THE WATERS EDGE IN FRONT OF THEIR HOME. THE ROAD IS ABOUT 4FT OFF OF THE SHORE LINE. THE (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) S HAD TWO ST. BERNARD DOGS ALONG WITH THEIR OTHER DOGS. THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT DRIVING PAST I SAW IN THE WATER WALKING AWAY FROM THE ROAD AND SHORE A LARGE 8'SASQUACHE. I LOOKED BACK IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR, AND STILL TURNED AROUND TO LOOK THRU MY BACK GLASS. MY WIFE SAW MY DISMAY, AND QUICKLY ASK WHAT’S WRONG, SHE AT THAT TIME LOOKED BACK, I ALWAYS DRIVE SLOW BY THEIR HOUSE AS THE DOGS ARE ALWAYS IN THE ROAD, SO SHE HAD TIME TO LOOK, ALL SHE SAW WAS THE RIPPLES IN THE WATER, AS WE PASSED A FEW TREES. IT WAS A FULL MOON NIGHT, AND NO WIND-CALM WATERS. NOW WHAT I SAW WAS THE 8' SASQUATCH CARRYING ONE OF THE ST. BERNARD HEADS. I IN THE TIME THAT DROVE BY SLOWLY SAW THE BIGFOOT FROM THE KNEES UP, CARRYING THE HEAD OF THE DOG, SOME FLESH WAS HANGING FROM THE NECK AREA. THE HEAD WAS IN THE BIGFOOT'S LEFT HAND. HE WAS CARRYING IT FROM THE DOG HAIR AT THE TOP OF THE DOG HEAD. I SAID TO MY WIFE AT THAT TIME THAT IF ONE OF THOSE DOGS CAME UP MISSING THAT THE SASQUATCH WAS THE REASON WHY. HOWEVER BOTH DOGS CAME UP MISSING AND WE NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN AFTER THAT TIME. NOW STORY UP TO DATE.  TELLING THE STORY TO MANY PERSONS IN THE YEARS PASSING, AS PEOPLE TELL STORIES, I FINALLY TOLD THE GUYS AT THE TVA WHERE I WORK AS A CONTRACTOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT. MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) IS JUST KNOWING EACH OTHER FROM THE WINDOW OF OUR VEHICLE AS WE WOULD WAVE TO ONE ANOTHER, AS OUR CHILDREN ROAD THE SCHOOL BUSS WITH EACH OTHER. I FINALLY ONE DAY ABOUT 4YRS AGO ASKED HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS DOGS, AND TOLD HIM THE STORY  OF WHAT I SAW. HE SAID ONE OF THE DOGS DIED IN HUNTSVILLE ALABAMA AT HIS MOTHERS HOME, AND THE OTHER DIED AT HIS HOME IN HONEYCOMB AND HE BURIED IT BEHIND HIS HOUSE. NOW. I DIDN'T PUSH THE ISSUE OF LETTING ME DIG UP THE DOG'S CORPS AS IT WOULD BE KIND OF TACKY. BUT IF YOU GUYS WANT TO CONTACT ME AND SEND SOME INVESTIGATORS TO CHECK AND SEE IF MR. (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DIG UP THE CORPS TO SEE IF ITS HEAD IS MISSING, YOU MAY GET SOME CLUES OR EVEN SOME HAIR FORM THE SASQUATCH. HOWEVER IF THE HEAD IS STILL ATTACHED, THEN I WAS HALLUCINATING THE WHOLE THING, AND MY WIFE WOULD JUST IMAGINED THE WATER RIPPLES TOO. I DON’T DO DRUGS, OR SMOKE DOPE, AND DIDN'T AT THAT TIME EITHER.  THE ONLY THING RUNNING THRU MY VEINS IS GOOD WHOLESOME NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD. I WOULD LOVE TO PARTICIPATE IN PURSUING THIS INVESTIGATION IF THERE WILL BE ONE.",
