  "observed": "I was walking out to fish in the puget sound at approx. 5:30am. There is a remote shoreline with very limited public access. The shoreline was surrounded by high cliffs, although there was a decommissioned submarine degausing station that was heavily wooded without the steep cliffs. The beach is rocky with lots of shellfish and washed up sea life from time to time, good fishing area. I could always turn over a rock and see hand fulls of crabs scatter. As the morning sun was rising I could clearly see approx. 150 yds a large dark hairy figure with facial (skin) like features bent over and what appeared to be turning over rocks. At first I thought it was a bear but quickly realized that it was to big and did not spend enough time on all fours like a bear. The animal looked up and that's when I noticed it's long skin like faicial features. It immediately walked away on two legs. Needless to say my friend and I did not fish that morning. We proceeded to sprint back up the hill to our cabin.",
