  "observed": "the first time i ever saw a sasquatch was in 1991. where i live is pretty rugged terrain so you would believe anything could be out there. i have figured out that if we do have sasquatch occasionally they do not live over hear because they are pretty much immpossible to find because ive been searching for years and one in a blue moon just when you think there is no possible way somthing could be out there you have somthing happen to make you think otherwise. well this is how my first sighting occured, it was about 2:00pm in the middle of April.  i was running through our garden with a bb gun just shooting around being a kid when i ran out of are garden i jumped up on this big rock that was on the top of this revine that lead down into this hollow which at the top of this mountain a small drainage ditch ran into it where i was at. well i jumped up on this rock and said \"Bang\"! well when i did i heard a branch break on the right of me and immediatly i turned and with in 13' of this creature that was about 5' tall whith this hair that resembled a rabbit in color but was long. it was standing kind of hunched over like a bodybuilder would do when showing his abs, it also had a pointed head but i don't remember seeing a face and im not going to make one up beacuse i don't want to tell a lie about somthing i didn't see. well it turned and ran through the woods away from me and i turned and ran away from it. as i ran i stopped to hear anything and i could still hear it running with lots of branches popping and cracking. as i continued to run i ran in the house to were my mom was and she said i was terrified so i grabbed my real shotgun and my mom and took her beacause i wanted her to see where it was at so we got back there and i found lots of big branches that had been broken and alot of slide marks for it was on a hillside. as i walked the little spilway that meets the revine i founf a very desernable footprint on the bank of it. it was about a size 6 shoe because that is what my moms shoe size is and we had it there for comparison and oddly enough it only had three toes. well this is really all i can tell you about this sighting i had but i will post my others soon. thanks for listening. wes",
