  "observed": "First of all I would like to say that I am a city girl and educated in medical science and not familiar with such things as Big Foot. I will say that I moved to Alabama 6 years ago, met and married my husband and he familiarized me with \"the ways of the wild\"...ie sounds, smells, woods, etc.  I learned as much about the outdoors as I could and visit them often to this day. The experience I am about to share occured in January 2007.  My husband belonged to a hunting club and we spent most of our free time enjoying waterfalls and creeks....looking at stars...sitting and talking, absolutely everything slips away when you go into the wild. We decided not to go to the hunting club this night, but to an old abandoned grave yard.  An elderly couple used to go there years ago and keep it clean from debris and weeds but since they died it is grown over. It seems to be such a peaceful place full of history and romance. We had been there often and this particular night my husband was, to say the least, enebriated, and we were just sitting in the car talking...the moon was very bright and the stars were all out.  I kept hearing branches breaking, to my left, I was in the driver seat of the car and my husband was in the passenger seat.  I thought it was probably a rabbit or another critter of the night...but I started to get a very creepy feeling...as if I was being watched...I felt this for a time before my husband asked me why I was looking to my left constantly.  I simply said I feel like I am being watched and shrugged it off.  The feeling did get stronger and I continued to look to my left into the surrounding woods to find out exactly what was giving me this eerie feeling.  This went on for quite a while...I also noticed a foul odor but could not pin point it's source..I thought it was my husbands usual bout of, well to put it delicately, indigestion...I eventually saw a very tall figure and told my husband that someone was in the woods and he was standing between two tall pine trees...He thought I was crazy and laughed it off...I never stopped looking and saw this figure sway from side to side...from tree to tree..never approached...never made a sound.  I looked for about 5 or 10 minutes before I was just too scared to stay there anymore, so we left.  A similar experience happened to my husband 5 years ago right after I moved here. It is currently posted on this site. I have been encouraged by Mr. M. Collins to post my experience..throughout this experience my husband never witnessed what I saw. He says he could not see anything out in the dark because of the glare of the dashboard lights (we had the radio on low). I am not sure what exactly I did see...I just know that I have frequented these woods for years and have never felt like that before...I do not intimidate easily and I was extremely ready to leave that night. I have gone back to the graveyard, but not nearly as often as before the incident. I am always on guard there.  I know I saw something and I don't believe it was a man.",
