As I was driving less than a minute a car heading to me was speeding and flashing there headlight highbeams.I didnt know if it was teens playing around or somebody that had to much to drink,so I blew it off.As I was coming to the curve there is a fence maybe 4 to 5 feet tall. as i was going around the curve my headlights caught something that looked to be 3 to 4feet taller than the fence. It looked at me with these red eyes.i felt numb,and frighten.I always think about the other person that was driving that night,what did they see.The sight has been devloped since then, trees almost gone",
