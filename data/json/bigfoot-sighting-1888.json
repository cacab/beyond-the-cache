  "observed": "I found what was left of a black and tan coonhound after it had been shot in the head and dumped at the Honobia, OK town dump. All the soft tissue (organs/muscles/connective tissue,etc.)was gone (with the exception of the entire head, the four paws and the skin and hair). It was apparently eaten by the same animal that had pulled upwards on the hound's chest wall and stretched out ligaments in an upward motion. The ligaments did not break but were stretched enough to easily remove the contents of the chest cavity. The ribs and the sternum, as I recall, were still held together by this stretched out ligament.The head was totally untouched except for the .22 cal. bullet hole in it's temple.  The hound's skin had been pulled apart over the abdomen and chest and peeled back and was laying in the same spot where it fell after being separated (on each side of the body, but still attached to the back of the dog. There were no teeth marks on the bones. The hound's eyes were still present and untouched.  Only inches away there was a dark and greasy spot that smelled, not surprisingly, like a dead dog...horrible. The dark greasy spot was about three feet in circumference and was on very hard flat ground. There was nothing noticible on the dark spot, just a dark tint to the ground. I believe that it took the use of human-like hands to pull the chest upwards in the manner that it was pulled and stretched out. I suspect a sasquatch.",

  "location_details": "The town dump is located on the north side of Boktuklo Mt. just half a mile south of Honobia. From the Girl's Camp intersection, go half a mile south, turn left on the first road. Cross the river and go about one quarter mile to the dump. There are other entrances to the dump, but this one is the one where I removed boulders that had been placed in the road in an apparent attempt to block it. (This was not a rock slide situation.)And trees broken in a series, not all at the same time, along the road leading to the dump.  This is, also, the location where I found, above a rock outcropping, a large western red cedar that had been used as a lookout tower by something of great weight that came up from the river. There were no trails leading to the tree. It was obstructed by green briars and there were bleached out, undisturbed leaves on the ground everywhere except the stone outcropping that extended about ten feet or so down to the river. There was a heavy wear pattern on one side of the tree as if it had been used as a ladder.  From that vantage point in the tree, traffic on Indian Hwy. and traffic on the road to the city dump could be viewed. (This lookout was not situated over a game trail.)",
