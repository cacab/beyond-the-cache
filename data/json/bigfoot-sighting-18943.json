  "observed": "the morning of april, 24, 2007. it was around 330-345 am. i was getting ready for work. after getting dressed, i took the dog out for his morning walk. it was a very still morning, no wind or any other noises to notice. it was unseasonably cool. the dog always has his normal routine, walk out the door, go to the edge of the driveway and use the bathroom. about the time he was making his way toward the end of the driveway he starts growling towards the treeline in front of the house. i was very attentive to him as he had never done this before. i stood there for about a minute trying to see into the darkness of the trees. as i was starting back to the house with the dog by my side. i heard a bone chilling howl and something that sounded like wood being hit on the trees. the sounds were, or it seemed only a matter of feet away. i quickly turned in the direction that i thought the sounds to be coming from and for a moment thought i caught a glimpse of something standing beside a tall tree along the treeline. i stood there for just a minute, but never noticed any more movement. after going back inside, i finished getting ready for work, went outside, as i was walking to my suv i could here twigs breaking from the footsteps. after getting into my vehicle, i put it into reverse and i could have sworn i saw something huge walk around the fenceline, up the adjoining driveway, around a pond that connects the two properties. at lunch when i returned, i noticed what looked like distured leaves on the ground in the area where i had seen and heard the thing. my dog to this day still will not go to the edge of the driveway without me. the howls sounded just like the ohio howl.",
