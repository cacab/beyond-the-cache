  "observed": "A friend and I decided to go hiking on the Fiery Gizzard trail in the Spring of 2000 or 2001.  We were hiking back to the trailhead through the gorge near the Fiery Gizzard creek when suddenly the woods literally erupted in the loudest screaming/whooping/whooing noise I have ever heard in my life.  There was definitely more than one of whatever was making this racket because I remember hearing screaming above the background of whooping and whooing sounds.  I remember thinking at the time that it sounded like one of the indian attack scenes in \"The Last of the Mohicans\" movie.  This went on for about 5 seconds and then complete silence.  I expected to hear someone laughing or running off but there was no sound of any kind.  I asked my friend \"What the hell was that?\"  He said it was probably boy scouts.  There isn't a boy scout alive with the lung capacity to make the noises we heard that day and we hadn't seen many other people if any on the trail that day as I remember. Nothing else unusual occurred for the rest of the way out.  I have hiked this area many times since this incident with nothing unusual happening.",
