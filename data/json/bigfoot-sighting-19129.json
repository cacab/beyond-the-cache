  "observed": "Three years ago I was up in the Cohutta Wilderness in N Georgia doing some hiking and fishing by myself. I set up camp at the remnants of an old logging camp, basically just a clearing. It was right next to a small river called the Conasauga river. As soon as I started setting up camp I started hearing what sounded like a big thick stick repeatedly getting wrapped against a tree. I don't remember how many times it was but I remember it going on for a minute or two. I low crawled down to the river and peeked out from under some trees and looked upriver where the sound was coming from but did not see anything. The sound stopped and I went back and finished setting up camp. After I set up I waded across the stream and went to where I thought the sound came from and found nothing but a bunch of beaver chewed trees. When I saw those chewed trees I attributed the noise to them. After that my entire trip there was quiet. I was by myself and was about 8 miles from anything resembling civilzation.",
