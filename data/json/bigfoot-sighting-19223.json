  "observed": "November 20th, 2006 @ 12:00pm while deer hunting in the Manistee National forest. My brother and I found a pair of tracks that are longer and wider than my 9 1/2 reebok's tennis shoes. The stride was about 6 feet long. We only found 1 set of tracks so I am not sure if what we found are bigfoot tracks. I came back 4 day's later and took pictures of them.",
