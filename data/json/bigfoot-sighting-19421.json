  "observed": "I am reporting this as a second hand report as my husband is the one who actually had the sighting. He is reluctant to share it with too many people and was stoutly a non believer in such things. He is a truck driver and was doing his usual Sunday courier run around 2:30 am to Tennessee. He was traveling on Hwy 75 North at exit 285, at Redtop Mountain, when he noticed a large biped figure walking into the tree line of the median between the southbound & northbound lanes. He said it was about 8 1/2 ft to 9 ft tall, greyish in color. He could not make out any other details. He only saw it because its movements caught his attention to that side of the road.",
