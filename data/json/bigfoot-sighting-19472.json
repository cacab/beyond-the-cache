  "observed": "I work for a tribal government in Wyoming and it is not every day we hear of things that go on in the community such as these sightings.  Over the years there have been reports of bigfoots and they were neither investigated or had anyone interested in really going out and finding the truth.  These sightings of this creature have been linked to various beliefs as well in the culture. About 15 years ago many thought the sightings of this creature, or this spirit, was a bad sign or warning.  Today, after many years I am again hearing about several co-workers seeing it in the same area. A river runs nearby as well as perfect willow patches and tree areas where something could hide. A bigfoot was sighted in broad daylight and persons were telling about it at the Health Fair about a month ago in May 2007.  I heard of this from some colleagues who would not make something up or embellish it. Another incident happened a week after the Health Fair. My co-worker has a girlfriend he lives with who took her sister home about midnight in the area of where a rodeo grounds and many trees are located.  She took her sister home on a dirt road and then they sighted the hairy big creature in front of their car lights walking on the road. They had no other way around it or any way to turn around and the creature stopped and turned to face them directly.  It was very frightening to them. I had a sighting on the reservation many years ago when I was a teenager. I had to open a gate near the highway where I live in Crowheart.  I was 15 at the time and I am now 41.  I seen in a snow blizzard a tall hairy man that walked rapidly across the road.  He was huge. It happened so fast it was almost unreal.  As anyone else can tell you the hair stands up on your neck, you get cold clammy hands, and your stomach flips over, and it seems like an eternity if the creature looks directly at you.  Now again last night on May 30, 2007, my co-worker states his mother seen something near their house which is in an area with lots of trees.  It seems it is hanging around near their home and perhaps they will catch it on camera phone or digital.  Meanwhile there may be others that have not yet come forth in this area.  Also, I know there must be some validity to this and someone could discover a very real creature since the sightings are becoming more frequent.",
