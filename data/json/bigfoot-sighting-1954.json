  "observed": "From the Union Democrat:  Warren Johnson, his brother Louis, and several friends experienced many unusual experiences above Strawberry, California.  They often found footprints, heard moans, grunts, snarls, snorts, tooth-popping and chest-beating.  Louis Johnson also reported that he had looked out through a hole in the shelter wall, saw a shape enter a patch of moonlight and leave again as soon as he tried to call someone's attention to it. Johnson estimates the size as 10 feet tall, four feet across the shoulders and as much as 750 pounds. Tracks were found that were 22 inches in length and had a five-foot stride.  The entire experience is accounted in \"Bigfoot\", by Ann Slade and Alan Berry, 1976, Bantam Books.",
