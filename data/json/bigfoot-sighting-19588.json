  "observed": "We were then living in Ohio. My husband had photography work to do and was being transferred to Indiana. In the fall of 1997 while driving south on Hwy 41 near Turkey Run State Park in IN, my husband and I saw what we affectionately call \"A something\". It was a misty night and we were headed for Terra Haute. I was driving my Ford Aerostar Van with my husband in the passenger seat (I was glad he was on that side) we also had our two year old son in the back seat. \"It\" was walking in the gully. \"It\" stood taller than the van so to speculate on the height I would say over 6\" easily. The body was black and hairy although the face was huge and long in the jaw shaped like a knight of a chess piece but not like a horse! My husband describes the face more like a lions shape. We passed it and continued our trip - and later even moved here with our child going to Turkey Run School. We travel the same road often from Turkey Run to Rockville and have never seen \"It\" again - YET!",
