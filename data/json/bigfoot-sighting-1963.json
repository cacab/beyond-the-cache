  "observed": "During the last week of August, 1999, myself and a friend left the Kennedy trailhead about an hour before dark.  After about 1.5-2 hours of hiking, we decided to camp.  We had just crossed the first major bridge over the Kennedy Soda Can Creek, and we doubled back a ways to a flat spot to camp for the night.  We were about 15 yards from the creek itself.  Around midnight to 1:00 a.m., I was drifting off to sleep when I heard a large, heavy, two-legged creature walking across the creek.  Since the creek was deep, I could clearly hear it splashing.  It would walk a little while, stop, then continue.  This went on for about a minute.  Although we did see another camper about 200-300 feet away, I can't imagine why someone would be walking across the creek at that time of night.",
