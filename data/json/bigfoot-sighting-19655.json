  "observed": "Last night, about 3:00 am I was awakened by a loud screaming sound from outside my house, all the windows were closed yet the sound was so loud that it woke me up.  I went to the front door and opened  it to see if I could here any better, by this time it had quieted some, but I could hear what was similar to the whoop-howls recorded on your sight coming from maybe a half mile away. At first I thought it might be coyotes, because I've heard them before in the area, but the sound was louder and hoarser without any yipping that usually occurs with coyotes.  I could hear dogs barking at the noise from a long ways away.",
