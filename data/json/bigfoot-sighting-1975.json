  "observed": "Well it was a few weeks ago in Loudon, NH.  Me and my wife had just settled into a house nestled next to a farm.  It was night time no real overcast or anything.  From inside the house we heard what we thought was barking constantly.  We own several dogs so we were used to it.  this continued for about an hour or two then quieted down.  Later on that evening about 2am or so we heard the most bloodcurdling sound ever.  The only way i can describe it is like about 20 dogs all screaming and yaulping at once in a shrill chorused scream.  We haven't heard it again but it came from across the farmer's field in the woods across from The speedway.  I'd have to say the date was around January 10th or so.  We have heard other things too and seen plenty of deer...but never heading across the field.  We don't know what it was and did not see it at all.  We have seen shadows move down the dirt road we live on but figured it was just someone walking up the road. Maybe we're just paranoid...but i've lived in the woods here a long time and never heard anything like that before.",
