  "observed": "My family owns land in West Virginia, so we went down camping this past Fourth of July weekend. We went to Seneca Rocks to climb them, and on the way down I took a shortcut away from my family. I realized the trail I took started to fade and I was lost, after going downhill a little while through rough rocky, tree filled and bush filled terrain that is home to deer, bear, and snakes, I heard thumps (footsteps) and tree branches cracking. I stopped and got cold chills, about 30 yards east of me on a 45 degree angle at 4:43 pm I saw the back side of a orange and brownish haired thing moving up hill quick. It had thick black hands and feet and I would guess that it was about 6'5 to 7'0 tall and again was moving up hill through rocks very quickly. I tried to go over to the area, but the sound stopped and it was gone, I found my way back to a path about an half hour later and made my way down to tell my family, who still donâ€™t believe me...I can say one thing, it sure was a crazy experience that raised the hair on the back of my neck.",
