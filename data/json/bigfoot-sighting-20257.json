  "observed": "My family and I recently spent some time living on the Delmarva Peninsula in VA. When the nights were cool enough we would open the windows of our fifth wheel trailer. On two different nights (the only nights we had the windows open) we heard vocalizations in the surrounding forest. On the first night it was about 2:AM and close to 50 degrees F. I heard two distinctly different voices coming from two different directions as if answering each other. This went on for about ten minutes as the sources seemed to move. Dogs in the small town nearby started barking almost instantly (and I do mean all of them). When I told the wife she blew me off because she is or was a skeptic. On the second occurrence the wife was alone because myself and the kids had gone back home too South Texas. She had the windows open and it was about 1:30 AM and close to 60 degrees. Both nights were very cloudy do to the cold fronts that had made the nights cooler. The wife is an avid outdoorsman and even lived in campgrounds from LA to WI growing up and always had the windows open weather permitting. This is important because nothing common wakes her up. She was sleeping when the vocalizations woke her up and made every hair on her body stand up. The sounds were of two or three different voices including one that she said was undoughtably male. They lasted for about five minutes and stopped as the dogs started barking when the subjects came closer to town. The voices were a cross between a woman making a blood curdling scream and a howl. The best I can type it out is AAAooOP! First one would sound off then another and on occasion a third. After her experience I played the wife some song clips off the internet and she said they were very close to what she heard.",
