  "observed": "This incident happened to me during the november deer hunting season of 1996. I was deer hunting on state ground that lies in back of our cabin in Iron county in Michigan's U.P. It is very rugged country with only a few foottrails that we keep open for access. The land is a mixture of high rock hills with very thick pine and hardwoods with dense swamps and small streams and creeks running through it, along the rivers are very thick tag alders which make the area outstanding for deerhunting. One evening when I was walking back to camp which was approx. 2 miles away I came around a bend in the trail and saw about 50 yds. in front of me a silhouette of what looked like a very large man in the middle of the trail. The ground was covered with about 6 in. of snow along with the trees so I could make out this dark silouette very well. I thought it was one of my buddies so I said fairly loud\" so, what did you see!\". Immediatly it turned and stepped across the trail and into the bush with no noise whatsoever. I stood there dumbfounded and scared for about 5min.Before I worked up the nerve to walk up the trail to where I had seen it,as this was the only way back to the cabin. I walked up to and past the spot where it was with my rifle leveled and the saftey off hoping not to see it again. I never did, it had just vanished without a sound. I hurried back to camp and never mentioned it to anyone.I went back the next day to look for sign of any thing but about 4in. of snow fell that night and I couldn't find anything. Over the years I've played this over in my head and the only thing I can come up with is that that for a brief instant I was talking to a bigfoot who didn't want to talk back.",
