  "observed": "about 8 or 9 years ago, when i was working as a patrol offficer for a company here in jacksonville florida, a friend of mine was in a building that was backed up next to a large area of woods.  he said that he saw something standing next to a pine tree. i told him that i would be there in about 10 or 15 minutes. i told him that i was in the woods chasing some poachers out. he said to come to the back side of the building and i did. i told him on the radio that i was back there and he told me to put on my spotlight and when i did , i heard a noise that i will never forget. i saw something running past the trees, it was tall brown and hairy and was running fast. i then got the hell out of there and went to see my friend in that building. he asked me if i heard that noise and i said oh hell yes. we then went to where it was standing and about 9 feet up was a broken branch from that pine tree. the branch was at least 5 or 6 inches in diameter and it was clearly pulled out. last night on the radio i heard that same scream. i tried to call but the line was always busy on coast to coast.",
