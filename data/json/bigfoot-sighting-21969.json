  "observed": "This happened last year during bow season in michigan. I had walked a large loup on my friends property and came up to the swamp part of the small lake. I sat down then heard the most eerie scream i have ever heard and i am positive it was not a deer or bobcat. It was almost human like but i could feel the anger in the scream. i was probally 50 yards from the lake with heavy vegitation and trees between the lake and me and the scream came from inside the 50 yards. After the scream i stood up and heard what sounded like huge rocks being thrown into the lake. I got out of that area as quick as i could.",
