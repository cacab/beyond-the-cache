  "observed": "Initial report received as the associated media article linked below. I spoke with James Hughes tonight and he sounded very credible. Mr. Hughes told me that on the morning of March 28th at approximately 5:15  a.m.,he was driving on County Highway H, approximately 11/2 miles from his home, in Clark County, York Township, when he saw a large dark figure up ahead in the road. As he got within approximately 35 ft. of it, he saw this creature step down into a ditch on the side of the road. When he was almost  up to it, approximately 200 to 300 yds. away, he said it was carrying something that looked like a goat or a sheep. When he got up to where it was, he slowed down to get a better look, and it turned and looked right at him. Mr. Hughes said that it was covered with fur, even the face area, except for two darker spots that were where the eyes would have been. It had large, honey colored patches of fur all over it. This area is aproximately 9 miles N.E. of the city of Neillsville and mostly farm land with some wooded areas. Mr. Hughes got out of there as fast as he could and did not report this to the Clark County Sheriffs Dept. until the next day for fear that people would say he was crazy. The Sheriffs Dept. sent a Deputy to check the area out but he did not find any footprints or other evidence. Mr. Hughes said that there  is a very large hayfield where he saw this creature and that the ground is very hard sod which would not show footprints. He thinks that this creature must have come across this hayfield.",
