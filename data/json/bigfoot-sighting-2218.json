The body except for the Face and Palms of the hands were covered with  neat short (one inch)dark brown to black hair flecked with gray hair.  The attitude was not especially threatening. It was more like a positive defensive move.The face was rather like a Gorilla(Dark skin and Dark deep set eyes, the head sloped back and was neanerthal shaped, had no eyebrows,prominent lips but not protruding, jutting square chin, no ears or teeth were seen,prominent nostrils slight nose (not flat like a gorilla) and an aged look to the face. The body was all big boned muscle, no body fat and had thick arms and legs. It made no vocal sounds and I did not notice any odor. I backed out of the ring of brush and walked quicky back to my truck. It did not pursue me!",
