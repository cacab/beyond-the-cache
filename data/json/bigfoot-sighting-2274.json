  "observed": "I went Deer hunting with my teenage son. When we got to camp we realized we had forgotten our tent poles, so after hiking around and having dinner, we settled to sleep on the ground. We did not have a campfire due to the dry conditions. I was sound asleep when I felt something touching my beard. (I had a very heavy beard/mustache and long hair at this time). It was gently rubbing fingers through my beard, not as if it was intending to wake me, only trying to figure out who or what I was. I would liken it to a blind person touching the contours of your face to try and \"see\" you. For some reason I was thinking of a squirrel or other critter. I did noticed an odor like burnt hair and decomposing meat. Very strong. I sat up and roared to spook whatever it was, away. It took off into the heavy brush in an area where it didn't have to cross dirt/gravel. I could hear it crashing through the brush on two legs. It was big and heavy, very noticable. As soon as I was oriented, I grabbed a flashlight to look for tracks and saw none. This was not a visual sighting--it was experienced through scent, touch and sound. After speaking with others who have had experiences in the woods, I strongly feel that I encountered a Bigfoot that evening.",
