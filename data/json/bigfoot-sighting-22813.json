  "observed": "About two years ago I was riding my bicycle with a friend of mine out in a rural area. Just out side of Calhoun, and just barely over the county line in to Walker County. I heard what sounded like heavy wood knocks. Big loud ones. At the time I just thought maybe someone was building something off in the woods. But now I’m more inclined to believe that it could have been a Sasquatch. Because there was nothing but woods, and fields in the section of the road where I heard the noises come from. I haven’t rode out there in a long while either so nothing further to report. My friend that I was riding with would have no recall of the incident. Like I said just sounded like building going on.",
