  "observed": "The following report was presented to me, Ranger Steve, on September 24,1994 at Mount Rainier National Park.  I was working as a National Park Service Ranger/Naturalist at the Longmire Museum when the following was logged on a National Park Service Natural History Observation Form 10-257. Subject of observation was \"Bigfoot Adult.\" The Description on Form 10-257: \"Location on highway 123, 7 miles from Packwood, Washington. At Forest Service Road 46, right next to #1270, I saw a reddish-brown bear-human like animal (6') stand up in the middle of road and run away (lumber away) on 2 legs.  I thought it was a Bigfoot. I'm 51, have a B.A. in Biology (CWSC) 1966.  I know what I saw was not a deer, a bear or an elk. It was humanoid. It was also hunting season, so I doubt it was a joke! Jim Fielder\" ...End of description on form. The ranger spoke with the witness at length about the observation and learned more details. They thought it was a female animal squatting to urinate. He intended to return to collect a sample. He went to his motel to get a container for the sample, but upon reaching the motel in  Packwood, he learned of a medical emergency involving his elderly mother, so he did not return to collect a urine specimen.  He reported the incident two weeks later. This report is also mentioned in the book \"Where Bigfoot Roams,\" author Robert Michael Pyle, page 105-107.",
