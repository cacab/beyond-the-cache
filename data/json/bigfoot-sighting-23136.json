  "observed": "Me and and buddy were driving from my house to his house which was about 15 miles, it was around 2:30 in the morning and i was driving, he was half sleep in the other seat, about 5 miles from his house we were driving by the budweiser factory and i looked over on the right hand side of the road and saw something large and greyish  standing the side of the road staring at our vehicle as we came closer, when we were about 20 to 30 feet from it, it turned around and started running through the field at a fast pace, it scared the crapt out of us and my buddy started freaking out more than me, i know its something ive never seen before and i know it wasent someone dressed up in some crazy gorilla looking costume, this thing was large and had to be at least 7ft tall, it was hairy with laid down looking greyish hair with long arms almost down to its knees, if i had to guess it was a male and he looked around 500 to 600 pounds at least, i couldnt see its face really good but i saw his glowing eyes as we came closer to it with the headlights shinning on it, i told a couple people about it and my buddy doesent speak about it no more but its haunting having to see something like that on the side of the road starring at you",
