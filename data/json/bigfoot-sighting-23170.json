  "observed": "I heard a series of low pitched, long howls while on a ladder cleaning the gutter of my two story house located about 2 miles NE of Granite Falls, WA. It was about 9:30 AM on a Saturday morning. Dogs began to bark once the howling started. The sound was nearly identical to the long howls heard in Ohio provided on this website on the audio clips page. My wife has heard these calls as well coming from the large ridge next to our house when we first moved out here.",
