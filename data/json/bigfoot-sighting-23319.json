  "observed": "When I was very young I saw a pair of Bigfoot tracks with my father. I’m guessing I was about 9 years old. I’m now 22. My father and I used to go rabbit hunting all the time. We always went to the same place and always saw dozens and dozens of rabbits. We would get up very early in the morning, about 1AM, so that we could get out to our spot about an hour before dawn. So it was a few hours outside of Bishop, CA. We would make sure to get there early so that we could sit in the car and wait for dawn to come. Just as the sun would start to rise and there was enough light to see we would normally see tons of rabbits running about, but that day was different. There was not a single rabbit in sight. That had never happened before. We stayed in the truck and waited until the sun was fully up before we decided to get out and take a stroll around to see if there was anything to see. Just before we left the truck my dad asked me if I wanted to bring the camera and I told him \"Na, we aren’t going to see anything out here.\" Ha-ha! Boy was I mistaken. We took off from the truck and went into the wilderness. There was nothing to see at all. No animals anywhere. We were walking along and suddenly we came upon the giant footprints in the sand. There were two sets of prints, one right next to the other. They were barefoot and looked just like human feet. Right away we knew what they were. It’s a natural thing that goes through your mind. When you see them you say yourself, \"Those are bigfoot tracks.\" The first sets of tracks were HUGE, and thee times as big as my fathers feet, and he is about 6' 3\" with a good sized foot. (He is very thin though). The second set of footprints was the same size as mine. Right next to its parents tracks. The tracks dug deep into the ground and my father and I talked about that. We tried to stomp on the ground to see if we make an indention as deep as theirs but we couldn’t, even with our shoes on. We followed the tracks and we came to a barbwire fence. On the other side was a paved road. On the other side of the road was a hill that went up and overlooked a valley. I was too young to notice anything about how the tracks crossed the fence and got to the road or if there was a piece of fur on the barbs, so I’m sorry that I couldn’t tell you anymore about that. On the other side of the road there were no tracks and we couldn’t find any more around. My father decided that we needed the camera, so I stayed at the fence while he went back the way we came to get back to the truck. It seemed like it took forever for him to return and being a little kid I was getting a little scared. But, he finally came back and told me that he could not find the truck! So when we were done looking around we took the road that we had found to see where it would lead us. It took us to a small town that we had passed to get to our spot. So we knew where we were form there and were able to finally get back to our truck and once we were there we decided we had gotten enough walking done for the day so we headed home.",
