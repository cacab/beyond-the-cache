  "observed": "After listening to the Bigfoot scream recording on your website I played it for two friends of mine and we all agree that it is exactly what we heard. In the summer of 1999 we were working on a cabin that my friend was building in Guernsey County about three miles from Seneca Lake. Around 2 AM we were awakened by a series of screams. We had no idea what they were. Later we figured they were a bobcat. When I listened to your recording I am positive that is what we heard and everyone agrees. I have heard it one other time in 1999, but not since. My friend who owns the cabin and his son also has heard this scream on other occasions.",
