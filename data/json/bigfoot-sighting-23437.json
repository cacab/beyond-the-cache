  "observed": "So much time has elapsed since this incident, so I am not sure of exact dates and times, so those aspects will be approximations.  However, I DO remember EXACTLY what I saw. It was approximately 9pm, and it was dark and cold.  I believe it was around Thanksgiving.  My girlfriend lived, at that time, on Green Mountain, about 6 miles outside of Keyser, WV.  The area is hilly to mountainous and I will enclose a mapquest picture of the area (although it has changed a bit since the picture was taken).  It is technically Rt. 46/4, and the sighting occured along this route, what is  now known as Green Mountain Road locally, but older maps may list it as \"Hoover Hollow Road\". I was returning home after dropping her off.  I was alone and beginning my descent back down the mountain, at approximately the halfway point. The road changes levels several times in a short distance at this point; many dips and slight rises before the meat of the descent begins.  I was in this section and on one of the rises when something on the left side of the road caught my attention.  There appeared to be someone sitting on a log on the bank above the road; the \"person\" looked at me and I realized it wasn't a person at all.  The motion of the creature-- for lack of a better term-- indicated that I had startled it-- very sharp, quick movements.  The eyes glowed yellowish/amber as my lights hit them; the being had long brownish fur with strands of white (maybe) through it; it appeared matted, or dreadlocked; the feature that struck me most was the size of the thing-- I can't even imagine the actual numbers but, I have a 300 pound Brother-in-law and a 6'3\" tall Brother and they both would have been dwarfed by this guy, both in height and weight.  I would conservatively estimate the creature to have been at least 400lbs and every bit of 7 feet tall.  Upon seeing my car, this creature stood up and jumped from the bank, landing somewhere near the middle of the 2 lane road, and began to run from left to right, into a deep pine and laurel thicket. I do not know why, but I stopped near the point that the creature entered the thicket and turned my vehicle off.  My windows were rolled down slightly, so I could hear the thing running through the thicket-- the sound receded quickly, as if it was moving with considerable speed.  I listened for mere seconds, before recognizing the stupidity of my actions forced my hand and I continued on. As I drove on, I saw what appeared to be a fire burning directly ahead of me.  The road bends to the right and the fire was actually on the same side of the road as the point where I observed the creature.  Around the fire, I saw several people.  They were talking and partying.  To me, it appeared that the spot where the creature was sitting was a PERFECT observation point for the happenings at the campfire.  And, I remembered him (I say \"him\" because I got the distinct impression of masculinity from this enormous creature-- barrel chest, thick arms and legs and just a \"maleness\" to it's movements) turning his head to face me and it turned in a way to suggest that it was looking TOWARD the clearing where the fire was burning.  I remember thinkin, \"Huh...  He just wanted to see what they were doing\". I immediately called my girlfriend after observing the campfire.  I told her that I think I just saw a Bigfoot, and I related what I saw.  She panicked and told me to come get her, but I was too spooked by then to turn around.",

From Rt. 220 in Keyser, turn onto St. Cloud Street.  Head west for several blocks, until you come to E street.  Turn Left onto E, and continue on Parkview (E becomes Parkview) and pass the playground on the left.  Continue past Potomac State Farm (Left) and St. Thomas Cemetary (on Right) and continue for approximately 2 miles up Green Mtn.  At the top, there is a sweeping left turn.  The slightly curvy section after this turn is the area where this incident occured.  It is between a public access to a hunting area and a residence.  They do NOT appear on the mapquest image as it is old.",
