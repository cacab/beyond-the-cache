  "observed": "This report is submitted by the investigator after a phone conversation with the witness about another encounter.  Ref: Report 23300 The witness, who was 12 years old at the time, was on a logging road watching for deer that might be pushed out by his relatives.  He was sitting in a truck by himself except for a small pug dog.  He said that he smelled a “dead animal” smell.  At that time, the dog began to get very agitated and was barking and trying to get out of the truck.  The dog leaped from the window to the ground.  It then went from being aggressive to being very frightened.  The witness said that the dog came back, cowered, wanted back in the truck, and peed all over itself.  There was a bank that went up from the road next to the truck. The witness said that he heard something moving in the brush above him.  When he looked up, he saw something moving.  Then the creature stepped out into the open about 40 feet away up at the top of the bank.  It looked at him for about 30 seconds, and made some grunting and mumbling sounds.  He said that it cocked its head from side to side a couple of times.  Then the creature turned and ran up the hill.  He said that the creature was 7 to 7 ½ feet tall.  The hair was dark brown, long on the arms, but shorter and more sparse on the chest.  The chest and stomach muscles could be clearly seen.  The witness was very frightened, and ran down the road towards his relatives.",
