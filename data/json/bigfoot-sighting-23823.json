  "observed": "I was 17 and had an 11:30 curfew.  I had left my girlfriend's house a little later than I should and was in a hurry to get home.  I traveled Howell Hill Rd to Teal Hollow Rd.  On Teal Hollow Rd I was speeding down a long straight away and saw something on the side of the road.  I thought it was a deer or cow at first, so I slowed down.  As I got closer to it, it stood up.  As I passed it I was still going fast, about 55 or 60.  I then thought it was a person who had crashed their car so I hit my brakes.  By this time I was past it.  I stoped in the road about 100 to 200 yards past it.  When I put the car in reverse to back up I could see that it had walked into the road behind me.  I probably got to within 25 to 30 yards of it when I realized it was much bigger than a person. It was dark so I do not have a great description. It scared me.  I threw the car in drive and floored it.  I drove like a bat out of heck until I got to HWY 64.  When I got home I was still shaking and still had tears in my eyes.  I do not know what I saw, but it was big, looked to be 6 1/2 to 7ft and almost half the width of my car.  20 yrs have past and I still will not drive that road anytime close to dark.  I get cold chills everytime I think about what happened.  It scared the heck out of me, whatever it was",
