  "observed": "The following is a letter written to The Mining Journal in May of 2008: \"BIG FOOT, Lock Ness...?\" A few weeks ago in your Sunday editorial page you ran a letter in reference to 'Bigfoot' Loch Ness Monster, etc., which I am sure some people might think is out of the question for anywhere in the U.S., let alone in the great Upper Peninsula. Well, I have an honest to God true story to tell, and then let your readers decide how possibly there might be a Bigfoot in our very own area. One night, about 38 years ago, my sister-in-law and I went to visit a friend in Three Lakes.  On our way home I was driving, and not but a few miles from our friend's home, which was on the highway, upon the arisen (sic) to the left, this massive white creature came to the top of the hill, and we looked at each other in disbelief as to what we were seeing. We said to one another, \"Oh, my God.  What the heck is that?\"  We freaked out.  I slowed some and kept looking at this huge white furry creature looking down toward us.  We just kept repeating to ourselves as to what we were seeing. I could understand some people saying, 'Oh yeah, they were drinking.\"  Maybe so, but all we drank were numerous cups of coffee as we visited our friend. As we drove in a rather hurried pace, rather shook up, we sped.  Unknown to myself at the time I had passed a police car, didn't realize it until we saw the emblem on the door.  My sister-in-law said, \"My gosh, now we passed a cop to boot.\"  We kept talking all the way home, wondering and questioning ourselves as to what we saw and if it was possible that it truly was this giant white furry Bigfoot as we like to call it. We have told numerous people our story and everyone kind of just says, 'Yeah, right,' and laughes at us, but we will stake our lives on this story and we will go to our graves knowing what we saw was \"Bigfoot or Loch Ness.\"",
