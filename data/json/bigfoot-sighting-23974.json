  "observed": "I was tent camping with my wife and daughter along Trout Creek about 1/2 mile west of the Clavey River. I woke up early but just laid in my sleeping bag for while. All of a sudden, I heard the \"scream\" which continued for 20-30 seconds and then it started again for about the same length of time. I thought I was the only one awake at the time but when I turned my head to look at my wife, her eyes were wide open. She turned her head to look at me and we both had that \"yep, that's what it is\" look. She was kind of freaked out about it but I was rather excited as I have been interested in seeing or hearing some kind of bigfoot evidence. The sound came from the northern direction which was upstream from us. It sounded as if it was kind of far and had a slight echo to it. It was very similar to other scream recordings that my wife and I have heard.",
