Location: Mason County, Kentucky - west of Maysville on U.S. 68 Investigators: Doug McGill (WFTM radio) and Dave Jones (Maysville police detective) Case Data: This incident is on file with the Maysville, Kentucky police department. We consider it to be valid. We cannot comment any conclusions because no researcher interviewed the witness. Mr. N.C., an Alabama truck driver was hauling steel west on U.S. Route 68 when he saw a figure on the opposite side of the highway. He slowed his vehicle and turned on his high beams thinking that it was a hitch hiker. When he approached the figure, he was shocked to see a 6-7 foot tall \"ape-like\" creature with white hair. After his encounter, he contacted some locals on C.B. channel 22 to see if there was a zoo or circus in the area. He thought that possibly an ape had escaped. When police were called to investigate, they took N.C.'s statement and filed a report. He stated to police that he had never been to this area before and knew nothing about alleged Bigfoot reports. (N.C.)had heard about previous reports from other C.B'ers. The police believe that Clay was serious on what he reported.",
