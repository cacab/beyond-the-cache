  "observed": "I had took the kids to Yell county Ark, to a horse Swap N Shop, We left at 8:00pm on hwy 27 North, Decided to head to Spring Lake. Used to take my kids there when they where young. It was 7miles west of Hwy 27.Had drove about 3miles on pavement and it turned to dirt. Hadnt been on the dirt road a mile or less and looked up the road and caught a black upright something on the edge of the road heading into the bushes.I know what I saw,but Im still in disbelief and feel strange telling anyone ,but I know what I saw. I wish I would have stopped and thought to check for foot prints, but It really spooked me and the kids after I told them.",
