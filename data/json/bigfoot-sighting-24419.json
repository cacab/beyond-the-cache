  "observed": "Ruskin Cave was a recreational park at the time and we were living there to work.  My daughter was followed home late one night. A bigfoot came up behind her and tried to take a large bag of candy from her.  It bruised her back. She came home literally in shock and could not even describe the incident for minutes.  While she was trying to describe it to me, I looked out our window and it was standing outside staring in at me.  I almost blacked out.  It was the size of it that shook me, as well as the look, and nearness of this creature, standing there outside our window looking in at me.  Several other people on the property heard its screams throughout that summer all over that property. It would make your hair stand up on your head and paralyze you for seconds when you heard it. I have seen grown men nearly cry when they heard it because they were so frightened. Animals go beserk when they hear those screams.",
