  "observed": "Three nights ago some friends and i were out and about at a spot where we usually search for these creatures.  and at least fifty percent of the time we can get audible results.  But on this night it was the best. We could hear them out there for about an hour and a half vocalizing.  the next night we couldn't go out again and waited until last night. we brought a friend with us who never \"bigfoot hunted\" before but was curious about our stories.  she being a experienced hunter and knowledgeable about the woods. That night was the best to date, and we thought that three nights ago was good. at one point they were so close to us. i would say less than 75 yards.  the sounds they make at that distance seem right on top of you. we could feel our chests vibrating. my friend G had a digital camera with so we recorded the vocalizations.  that night our curious friend agreed and told us nothing she has ever hunted makes those kinds of noises.  we were afraid the camera might not pick up all the sounds.  to our pleasant surprise it did.  we would like to send you guys the recordings, to get the professional opinion though.  thank you",
