  "title": "Man recounts his possible daytime sighting while bowhunting near Crestview",

  "observed": "While bowhunting from a tree stand in a row of trees looking out over a field, I saw a very large animal walking on it's hind legs come out of the woods towards me, turn to its left, walk in front of a large oak tree, then turn to its left again and reenter the woods. The distance between the tree and animal vs myself was approximately 2000 ft. I was dropped off at this area by two other people I was hunting with. I walked roughly 1000 feet into the brush and found a pine tree with a good view to set my tree stand up in. I was in an area with light to moderate pine tree population with a large amount of waist high grass and brush. My view from the tree stand opened up into a field with little to no pine trees with a dense tree line of mixed oak and pine trees on the far side of the field. A prominent tree that stood out from the rest and encroached on the field was a very large oak tree that dwarfed the rest. This is the tree the animal crossed in front of. After watching for deer for what seemed like an eternity, something caught my eye across the field at the oak tree. My initial reaction was it was one of the people I was hunting with. I took a look through the binoculars but still couldn't get a positive ID on who or what it was. Oddly, one of my first thoughts before I raised the binoculars was, \"What is James (one of the hunting party) doing wearing a black suit in the woods?\" That's what it looked like from so far away. It looked and walked eerily like the famous bigfoot video clip you see everywhere. A very humanoid gait with the upper limbs swinging in opposition to the lower limbs. The entire episode lasted maybe one minute. There were no sounds made that I could hear at that distance and by the time the hunting crew came back to pick me up it was too dark to investigate further.",
