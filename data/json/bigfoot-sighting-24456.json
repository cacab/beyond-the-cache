  "observed": "During the early morning hours of August 14th at 1:am; I was laying in bed when I heard this god awful sound out of my bedroom window coming from my back yard.  I never heard anything so awful in all of my life.  In my life time I never heard a wild animal that could make an awful sound like that. I’ve heard through the years about this big foot stuff, and I’m not sure what this thing was, but while I was at the window looking I could hear foot steps in the leaves. It made the sound three times, so I made a mad cat fighting sound, and it was then that I heard the foot steps leave my yard and I know that it was human steps and not animal sounding steps. I went back to bed, but I could not forget that sound. A friend called the next day and I was telling them about it.  He told me there was some guys on the news who had found a dead big foot back east.  He told me to go to your web site for pictures, so I did for fun.  I looked at all of the pictures and listened to the different sounds, and when I got to the last sounds on your site page, I freaked out, because that was the same sound that I heard that morning. The next night it was back again, but this time I saw out my window this hairy thing which was very-very tall. I have been freaked out ever since, and I can’t sleep, because this thing is very upsetting.",
