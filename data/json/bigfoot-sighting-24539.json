  "observed": "This was on my Grandparents farm. It was 2 miles down a dirt County road and 1 mile down logging roads. My cousin and I had gone out to the farm to camp and fish over the weekend. We arrived early in the afternoon and set up camp in a clearing near the lake and started fishing. Around sunset, a large thunderstorm came in and we sought shelter in an old barn approx 100 yds from the lake while the storm blew through. We had left the fish on a stringer in the lake with the stinger tied to a small tree. As we were waiting in the barn I looked back at the lake and during several flashes of lighting I saw something approx 7-8 feet tall, walking fast on it's rear legs, with it's arms swinging in a natural humanoid motion. I had a visual on this creature for 3-4 seconds between lighting flashes. I turned to cousin to see if he had seen what I had seen and he said he had. The creature was dark colored, walked upright on its rear legs naturally and averaged 4-5 feet between steps (I have no way to prove that as the rain washed away any tracks).  Also the next morning the fish on the stringer were eaten. I have been around animals my whole life, both domestic and wild. I do not understand why this creature would be moving during a thunderstorm. I still donâ€™t know what we had seen that night but I know that we saw something. When we got back to our place, we told our grandmother what we has seen and she said it was probably a bigfoot. She said she used to see them as a little girl growing up in South Houston County in the Big Thicket.",
