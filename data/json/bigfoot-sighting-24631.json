  "observed": "On Monday, Aug. 25th at approximately 7:30 p.m. my friend and I were traveling westbound on Hwy 26 approaching Rhododendron.  We observed a car parked off the road in the east side emergency lane.  The car in front of us pulled off abruptly and we wondered if there was an accident or animal that had been hit by a car.  We proceeded slowly around the vehicle when an \"ape-like\" creature approx 6 ft. tall sprang from the woods.  It crossed the road behind us and was nearly hit by another westbound car.  We were approximately 10 ft. from the creature which appeared to be standings somewhat erect, but when it ran it ran with its hands on the ground like a monkey or gorilla.  We are sure that the others in the vehicles on the side of the road observed the same creature.  We are surprised there are no recent reports from this sighting.",
