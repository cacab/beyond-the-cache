  "observed": "I have spoken verbally with an investigator about this incident, but never filled out a report. The more I think about it, the more relevant it seems. So this is my report: I had been camping on family property for two days waiting for others to arrive. This property once had a cabin on it that was destroyed in the late sixties by an avalanche, but the concrete slab is still there, and we park RV's on it. I had been sitting in a folding chair reading for a couple of hours when I heard a very large branch snap. It was loud like a gunshot, or at least seemed that way with all of the quiet. Immediately after the snap there was a commotion as some of my nearby items (gas cans and trailer dolly) fell from their spot behind an old wooden shed about 35 feet from me, and something very large moved through the trees for about 30 feet and stopped. As soon as the branch snapped, I shot out of my chair and then heard the rest of the commotion. It really scared me, and I looked around for the dogs. They were cowering at the door to the trailer, which is strange because they usually go after anything out there. I wanted in the trailer just as bad as they did. As I approached the door, I got the feeling that the animal in question was a short distance away watching. It was very unnerving. We went in and locked the door.",
