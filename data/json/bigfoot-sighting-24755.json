  "observed": "I was driving a truck while hauling a dozer on a trailer.  My task was to deliver the dozer to a logging site.  It was early morning and I'd driven east out of North Bend, WA along the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River on SE Middle Fork Road which turns into NFD 5060 Road east of Mt. Si.  I then took a logging road on my way to the drop off site. As I drove down the logging road, up ahead along the side of the road I saw two tall people walking in the direction I was heading.  My first reaction was that they were really tall and must be basketball players.  As I got closer, it looked like they were wearing dark colored full body wetsuits with hoods.  I tried to make sense of what I was seeing and thought maybe they were bow hunters wearing a special suit.  As I drove closer I could see that they both had unusually long arms and that one had a more female shape and stood about 7 feet tall compared to the other which had a male shape and stood about 8 feet tall. The subjects then reacted to my approach by stopping and turning around toward me and stood in the middle of the road in a slightly crouched position.  They seemed agitated and with their feet stationary they turned and looked at both sides of the road by rotated their upper bodies at the waste back and forth, back and forth while swinging their arms at their sides.  When they did this, they looked very ape like. As I closed to about 35-40 yards away, the female jumped and ran off the left side of the road toward the river and disappeared into the brush.  The male stayed in the road a little longer shuffling to the left side of the road.  Finally, as I got even closer, in one step from the edge of the road he jumped a distance of around 20 feet and easily cleared what I now could see was a thicket of thorny blackberry vines at least 8 feet tall, and he was gone. They were both dark brown in color from head to toe.  Their faces were dark brown also.  I didn't really notice if they had fur or hair.  Perhaps the fur or hair was wet and matted down from the rain.  I didn't notice any odor or sounds. I continued to the drop off site 1-2 miles further down the road and began to unload the dozer.  Another driver who was less than a minute or so behind me on the same road arrived.  After unloading and somewhat composing myself, I asked the other driver if he'd seen anything strange along the logging road on his way in.  He said he had not.  I then left the drop off site and stopped at the encounter location.  I looked around but did not find any large tracks in the thin layer of snow along the side of the road.  There was no snow on the dirt/gravel logging road itself.  I didn't want to battle the blackberry vines to follow the creatures' escape route into the forest, so I took off. The only explanation I have for what I saw is that the creatures must have been sasquatches.  Because no human could be that big and jump like that and I know they weren't bears. ",
