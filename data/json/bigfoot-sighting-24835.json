  "observed": "I am 21 years old, live in Eatonville, Wa, under Mt. Rainier, have been researching the Sasquatch phenomenon since I was 7 or 8 years old, and this is the first encounter of any kind I've ever had. I was laying down to sleep on Sept. 29(my room and window faces the woods) when I heard the first of a series of vocalizations. First, I heard a distant call. It sounded kinda deep and man-like. Then, about 20 minutes later, the neighbors dogs on the other side of the 5 acres of woods between us started losing their minds and barking their heads off, and almost immediatly, I heard 4 or 5 siren-like calls(think of the vocalization that you hear on the 1994 A&E Bigfoot documentary). Very loud, very clear. From the 3rd call on, they faded as whatever made them seemed to be heading back deeper into the woods. Then, about 10 to 15 minutes later, the dogs went off again and I heard this chatter-like vocals, almost threatening sounding. It seemed to have a variation of sounds within the chatter. Like a mix between human-like barks/grunts, and an indescribable chattering that I just cannot explain. It did this for a few minutes, off and on. Seemed like it was taunting the dogs. And finally, it made a few fading groans as it seemed to head back to the deeper woods for the last time. And that was the last I heard of it.",
