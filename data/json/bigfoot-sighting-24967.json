  "observed": "Me and a long time friend were camping in the woods near Heavener, Okla by Tram Ridge Road.  About 5:15pm we heard what sounded like an ape at the zoo. We sat and listened to this for about two minutes and then there were knocks coming from the area of the creek below us. We thought it was a woodpecker at first but the knocks were to slow and too loud for it to be that. We had read where that is the way they communicate so we decided to try for ourselves. I really don't think this was a good thing. When started to bang two logs together. The knocks got closer to us and we heard more knocks start so we stopped. About one to two minutes after that some rocks came flying into camp and these were not small stones that you could throw a long ways. These were about 4 to 5 inches in diameter. As soon as it stopped we were on guard for the rest of the day and that night just got worse. We went to bed about 10:30pm and all sounded good until there were walking sounds outside our tent and the sounds of what we thought was something smelling along the seam of the tent and around the windows of the tent. After that night we heard nothing the next day.",
