  "timestamp": 303523200,
  "observed": "I was doing seismic, drilling in the Angelina National forest for several weeks.  Late one afternoon, in a opening, we decided to stop and take a break, on the upper end of an open area in the thick woods. It was quiet, when I saw something, large and dark brownish, stand up and walk away from me. It was approx; 100 yards away. It walked 20 to 50 feet then descended into a ravine, it looked to go down on all four legs as it went into the ravine then it was gone. I thought it was a bear, but chances of seeing a bear in 1979, would be slim.This animal walked on two legs. This only lasted for just a few seconds,10 maybe. I turned to my coworker and asked, \"Did you see that? he said yes, and what the bleep was that?\" I have thought about this for several years and in my mind's eye I can still see the animal walking away from me to this day, 30 years later.",
