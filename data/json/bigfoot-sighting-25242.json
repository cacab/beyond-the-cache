  "observed": "This incident occurred in the later part of 1983 (September I believe) just outside of Richmond Kentucky in Waco. I was about 12 years old and was out riding my bike when I decided to go visit a friend. He lived about a 1/4 mile off the main highway at the end of a gravel road. His house was the only one on the road and was completely surrounded by thick woods. After arriving, I walked to the door and realized nobody was home. As I returned to my bike I heard a loud crash from the side of the house, I quickly looked ad saw a large black figure tearing a huge limb from a tree. The figure was at least 7-8 feet tall and covered in thick black hair, couldn't guess the weight, but it was big. The figure was standing upright and was looking right at me, it was no bear. I quickly jumped on my bike and peddled like hell toward the main road. The ride back to the main road seemed to take forever and the entire distance back I could hear branches breaking and what appeared to be heavy footsteps running along side me; I was terrified. I thought for sure I was about to be attacked, then I hit the main road and it stopped. I kept riding, but couldn't help but wonder why whatever it was stopped chasing me once I hit the road. I don't know what it was, but I do know if it were a bear it wouldn't have stopped, and it was fast because it was able to catch a terrified kid peddling his butt off. I had another encounter, this time with witnesses, in the same area when I was 19, but that's another story",
