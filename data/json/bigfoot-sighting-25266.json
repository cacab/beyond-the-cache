  "observed": "NOTE: Please see the following included sections for elaboration of details.  Two of us were driving home from a day of skiing at Mammoth Mountain California. The road was a two lane highway (opposite directions) with a soft dirt shoulder. We were in an open convertible (because the skis did not fit otherwise). The moon was full and the lighting was un-obscured and visibility was (near daylight) excellent. In the distance (well beyond the reach of the High beamed head lights) two of us could see a very large and (completely out of place) thing running ahead of our approaching car. It was on the other side of the road. We slowed, 50, 40,30mph... now in our headlights. Running on the dirt shoulder, obviously unaware of our approaching auto... There it was \"Bigfoot\"! At its closest point we were 10 UNOBSTRUCTED FEET FROM IT! EYE TO EYE!",

  "location_details": "We were on a two-lane road, slightly elevated highway, with the equivalent of a dirt emergency lane located on the opposite side of the road.  This is where the biped 'creature' was running in the same direction as we were driving, but on the other side of the road. From the time 'it' came into our completely unobstructed view, to the time we came eye-to-eye (perhaps ten feet away) was perhaps 40-60 seconds. Look at your watch, count the seconds, because the viewing seemed an eternity. The level valley (which the highway was constructed upon) had some knee high shrub for perhaps half a mile on each side of highway then the sharp incline of mountainside with pine trees above.",
