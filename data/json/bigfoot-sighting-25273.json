  "observed": "I recently moved out of my house in Girard, IL. During the last year or so I have experienced several strange occurrences. I have never actually seen anything except once  a large dark shape moving bipedally through the heavy fog.  I have heard the sound of something drumming on tree trunks. The sound of something BIG walking in the woods, on 2 legs.  I have found chunks of firewood thrown from my wood pile.  And on November 25 of 2008, as I was packing to move I heard a moaning howl very close to the house. I have hunted for 20 years and I have NEVER heard the likes of this. I stopped loading the vehicle, loaded my .45 and locked the door.  I did the rest of my packing the next two nights armed but as before I had the distinct feeling I was being watched and several times large branches were broken, and there was knocking on trees. Also there is an area of the woods where the grass and foliage is crushed down. This could be deer, but since these things have started occurring, the deer , who are usually thick as fleas have been gone.",
