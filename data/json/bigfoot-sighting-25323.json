  "observed": "Younger Brother: In 1992-93 we went to visit family friends.  And when playing outside us kids built a tent-like fort over the clothesline.  With sheets and clothespins.  Then later when were called in for dinner we went in and ate.  Then watched a movie.  And as now it was late we decided to leave on wishing us farewell the owner of the house saw the fort with her sheets still up and said \"no one is going anywhere until those sheets are in the house\". So me being little I got out of the work and got to sit in the van with my mom. Who turned on the head lights so they did not have to dismantle the fort in the dark.  As we are watching this my mom says \"hey do you see that shadow over there by the tree?\"  and I tried to look but could not make it out.  so she took a flash light and shined it in the vicinty but not directly on it hoping not to spook whatever it was that was only 20-30 feet from the kids and the clothesline.  she asked me again if i couls see that thing just standing there watching the kids take down the tent-fort. when i said no she called over my big brother who instantly saw what she was talking about. And in his excitement he grabbed the flash light ran towards it. and i will let him take it from here. Older Brother: I approached the clothes line and held the light on the trees just beyond us and never did shine the light on this shadow figure due to i was afraid too. But what i remember from then was seeing the out line of a dark colored figure. It was adifferent shade  than the tree bark. it was near 6 in a half feet tall or maybe 7 feet. I was about 5'9\" at the time and i felt very short upon seeing this shadow next to the tree about 20 feet from me and my sister and her friend. We all saw this outline of a tall man near that tree when i told the girls that there was something by that tree watching us. It never moved from its position by the tree it stood up right and just seemed to watch. We hurried quickly and gathered the sheets off the line and i threw them in a bag and gave them to the friend as i was scared and so was my sister. We ran to the van and she got in first and i followed. My seat in this van was not a normal seating position. My folks had installed another van seat in the van that faced out the back window. This was the seat i took and sat in this night. Mom backed down the drive way. As she turned on the road the head lights passed over the spot where the figure had stood and everyone but me at this time say they saw the what looked like a upper body shape or a set of shoulders that where large. Mom started to drive forward towards Wadena and as we pulled away from this sighting of this shadow and figure. I watched in terror as i saw it running down the tree line towards the road we were on heading home. I told mom to drive faster and to this day she claims she was doing about 30 miles an hour on this dirt road. I watched this thing take and turn at the ditch and run real fast and real close to our van it had kept up for the first half a mile. Before it must have given up on following us anymore. It never ran on the road it stayed in the ditch and was fast. It didnt pump its arms when it ran like a sprinter does. The arms of this beast swung long and almost like with ease right in stride with its long stride as it kept up very well with the van. I know it didnt run like a mile or anything but it was almost a half mile that it did and never lost speed or footing in its steps as it chased us. Younger Brother: I would like to add someting now to my brothers discription. First off will never forget the feeling of not knowing what was going on when he hurried and took down the fort quickly.  I could tell he was scared and remember very clealy as he ripped the sheets off the line the clothespins popping up in the air madly.  I knew something was wrong,  I was eight or so and this was my big brother.  Nothing scared him.  He was like the strongest person knew. And when my brother said it was chasing us his seat faced the back but I turned over the second seat and you could see it plainly in the red light provided by the tail lights.  There was a shadow on two legs not more than ten feet from us running in the ditch after the van.  It was very fast and especially for its size.",
