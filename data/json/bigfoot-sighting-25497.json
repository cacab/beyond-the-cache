  "observed": "Just two nights ago,( 2/16/09) my brother who lives up the hollow from my house called a little after 8 p.m. to say he had seen something outside in his yard. It seemed to be turned in the direction of his chicken house, at an angle to him, where it could keep a lookout both toward his house and the driveway which passes on up further into the hollow where there is another house. I have another brother that lives right across the driveway from the first brother. This brother says that two nights (2/14/09) before my brother saw what he did, he thought he saw something standing at the end of my 1st brother's screened in porch, my second brother was smoking on his screened in porch, and when he opened his screen door to get a better look, my 1st brother's pole light (which has a short in it) went out, and he couldn't see anything at all in that direction then. A few years ago, a third brother and neighbor to these other brothers, was walking in the dark without a light to my 2nd brother's house, and something screamed like a woman at him, and terrified him. This is a man standing 6' tall and over 300 lbs. My 1st brother is also 6' tall and over 300 lbs, and the creature he saw was taller and weighed more than he did. But he said it didn't seem to be fat. It had reddish brown fur-hair. He did not see the facial features due to the profile stance the creature was in and he said that it seemed to be aware that it, my brother yelled out loud, \"What the heck is that!\" and ran toward his front door that opens to his screened porch, he said that he felt the creature heard him and knew it had been observed and when he went to the front door and stepped out on the screened in porch, it was gone. The dogs didn't show up until my brother yelled for them. I myself have had a couple of things happen to me, that at the time they happened were unexplained but now I wonder if they are not related. Last fall my daughter and myself were leaving her house, she lives at the bottom of my hill near the creek, when something that screamed like a women terrified us. Then I heard what sounded like someone hit the side of my house under the breezeway where my bedroom is located, and I have had what sounded to me like a man walking across my house again over where my bedroom is located and in a minute or two it retraced its steps. I was very frightened to say the least!",
