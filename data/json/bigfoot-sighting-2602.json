  "observed": "I lived at Scenic near Stevens Pass Washington in the 60--70's.  There had been sightings of sasquatch near our home, and at that time my husband and I laughed about that never taking them seriously.  I lived at Scenic about 10 years and enjoyed taking walks by myself with my samoyed dog. That dog would chase bears away, running them up trees. I always felt safe with her around.  One morning, the dog went with my husband to work and I decided to take a walk down to the end of the road towards highway 2. It was a beautiful spring day and the snow still lay in places on the ground.  I can still see and hear this like it was yesterday. I had crossed the small bridge going over the small creek by our place and gotten almost to the end of the road where it meets the highway.  That's when I heard the most god awful sound.  I can still hear it in my mind. The sound was quite close to me. I'm thinking about 1/2 block distance (as the crow flys) and seemed to be coming around the area where the deserted railroad bunkhouses were located across where the depot was located. This animal had huge lungs. The volume was immense. (I'm trying to think of a word for the sound) It started sort of like roar and went to a shrill pitch. Then a pause of about 3 seconds and then the same sound with that shrill pitch, a pause of 3 seconds and another sound. That was it and since I didn't believe in saquatch I wasn't scared of it, ,just curious. I knew all the calls of the animals around our mountains and this wasn't the same. I've tried all these years to figure out what made that noise. I stopped into the forest service office after this happen and asked them if they had ever heard this sound. I was trying to explain it to them as best I could, but they never took me serious. I recieved the same response from my friends that lived in skykomish.  Then after I moved to Spokane some time later I was watching \"Unsolved Mysteries\". They played sounds that sounded very similar and said to myself \"there's the sound or closest to it\".  I thought, \"no one's going to believe this!\" I worked at a hospital in Spokane and one of my indian patients and I got to talking about my experience. She had seen a sasquatch come into her camp as a young girl and chased it away by beating on a drum. She said the most astounding thing she remembered about her experience was the human look in it's eyes. So the native americans have known about them for years. I truly think the sasquatch would be found around that area of Scenic, near Stevens Pass Washington. For 10 years I walked all through those mountains, my small children with me and these sasquatches never bothered us.",
