  "observed": "Hello, my name is Thomas G., I live in Medford, Oregon, I travel to the Applegate Region, Del Norte,Humbold regions quite often, mostly Applegate in the Red Buttes Wilderness, I had a confirmed sighting June 3, 2009, and have had strange occurances since 07 in this area.  I'm still very emotional about with what I seen, and can describe every moment. I didn't know what was gunna become of me, because it's weird trying to anticipate what it was going to do, it was 50 yards are closer to me, I watched as it ducked behind some brush by a boulder on the hill, looking down upon me. 6-7 foot tall before ducking down behind brush, ovalish head, Reddish/Dark brown fur, I seen the sulight shining off of it's shoulders which were as big as a linebackers with full gear, amber/brown eyes, flat faced, long hair matted, and big ass eyes staring straight through me, I was crippled in fear until the adrenaline started to kick in, and I ran, and jumped down the hill which was about 8 feet above the road, ran into my car, told my friend who was with me by the river, to get into the car now, we need to go, and I didn't stop until I got home, and out of the woods. I had planned to spend the day there swimming, and fishing the Applegate River, I have to say we were only there for less than an hour, 60 miles away from my house, so it'd be a waste of gas to take that trip for only an hour, I left my house at 9:30a.m. and was back by 11:15, I admit I was speeding the whole way to my house.  If it were a bear, it would of crashed off into the woods before I even would of known it was there, cuz it would of known I was there, or if it were a Mountain Lion, I probably wouldn't be typing this to you. I know what I saw, it wasn't a bear or cougar, they don't walk on their hind legs. I grew up in the Wilderness of Klamath Falls, Oregon, I've seen the animals that God has put on this planet, and this isn't anything I've seen before except on all these videos of sightings, Think of Patty, that's what I saw, I dunno if it was threatening at all, it was to me, there's been alot of unsaid sighting that happen in the Red Buttes Wilderness which extends from the Ore/Cal boarder, to hwy 96 Siskyou county, Saied Valley, Happy Camp, Indian Creek Road, Oregon Caves National Monument, and prolly 1000's of more.I read on a report that a hippy farmer from Talkemla says that he and his cohorts since they were little have been warned about the bigfoot living in this area, and that they are highly territorial,aggressive, and traveling into this area, is putting yourself in oppotunity/danger of running into one of these creatures.  please contact me, nobody else will, I'm not frauding,making this shit up or anything.",
