  "observed": "while fishing early in the morning at Eastfork Lake near batavia,ohio,my nephew and I heard first an owl hooting a couple of times and I told Cody that I'd never heard one there before.It was around 3 am,After a few more hoots all of a sudden a loud noise came from the woods.A noise that I've only heard in a jungle scene in a movie.The sound was of chimps in trees,warning of danger present,it was very strange.After about an hour had pasted,we heard the owl noise again and then broke out in a loud low scream,over and over we heard this scream.then it went into what sounded like dogs barking,maybe a few dogs and then the barking went into yelping like they were being hurt.Then it stopped.We didn't hear anything again.Occasionally we'd hear the sound of a large rock being thrown into the water about 100 yards away.We left alittle later after all that went on.",
