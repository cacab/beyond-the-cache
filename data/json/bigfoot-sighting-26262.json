  "observed": "My girlfriend and I was returning home in the early morning hours, around 3am, on the date of June 28th 2009. I play lead guitar in a well known band in the Atlanta area. For this, it's late when I do come home. We live in a area that is very rural with lots of farming land and needless to say we are surrounded by woods. On this particular night we were less than a half of a mile from home. We were traveling past a pasture when I saw a figure cross the road in front of me. My girlfriend also seen it and asked me if I had saw it. I told her yes but that was the last we spoke of it untill later that day. We started describing to each other what we had seen and the first thing I told her that it looked to me like it had reddish colored hair. Then I said to her that I didn't want her to think I was crazy but it looked to me like it was walking on 2 legs...not 4. As I said this to her her I could see that she was shocked by what I told her. Then I asked her what she had seen. She had seen the same thing and even told me that whatever it was had reddish eyes. We saw a creature that stood about 6ft. Tall and moved rapidly from left to the right side of the road",
