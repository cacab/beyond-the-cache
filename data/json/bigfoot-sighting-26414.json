  "observed": "A friend was visiting from out of town and so we decided to take advantage of the clear skies and mild temperatures and go for a road trip.  We had just been down near Window Rock, AZ and were heading back to Farmington, NM.   The easiest way to do so is going over Narbona Pass.  The speed limit on this road is 65 and I was travelling at 65 when coming around a corner just south of the picnic area (there is only one area that is located east just off the highway).   As I came around the corner I noticed something moving rapidly in a diagonal direction up the side of the hill just where the forest meets the meadows lining either side of the highway. It would be the east side of the road.  I slowed down and said to my friend \"Did you see that?!\"  he had seen it as well.  I hit the brake to get another look but knew that by the time I backed up it would have been long gone. What we saw was larger than a black bear or elk.  Blackish-Brown hair that could be seen hanging from all over its body.  It was running on two legs up the hill.  It never looked over at us and we only saw its side and back.  Broad and at least 7 ft tall. We were both under the impression that we had startled it and it was quickly trying to get into the forest cover. We stopped a mile or two up the road where the road crosses this creek at an ancient lava flow.  The whole time we were out looking at rocks there was an eerie feeling that we were both getting that something was watching us.  We stayed around for an hour and when the sun started to get lower behind the mountain we decided it was best to leave. ",
