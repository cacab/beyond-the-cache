  "observed": "while out looking for deer tracks in the B'Darcs River Bottom in remote area on private property, not accessible by public, we noticed twisted branches. After looking further we found a barefoot print measuring appro 14\". after going into creek bottoms, we found more footprints approx the same as before. We went deep into bottom later that evening and heard tree knocking from 3 different locations. We sat til after dark and continued to hear unexplainable noises. After dark in total darkness, we heard objects being thrown thru wooded area at us. I was too afraid to wait around. This property is located approx 6 miles south of Monkstown Tx.",
