  "observed": "Started on a three day hike in Gifford Pinchot National Forest on 8 Sept 09 at trail head #48 near East Crater.  After the first day of hiking into Indian Heaven Wilderness and spending a cold night at Elk Lake, I decided to hike to a lower elevation near Forlorn Lakes in which I camped on the second night (GPS N45 57.889 W 121 45.536).  I was outside a designated camping site about 200 meters west in a small valley that paralleled road Nf6035.  No one was occupying the camp grounds nearby that night and it was a very quiet night, until I was awaken with what I describe as three consecutive whooping yells followed by a guttural scream that lasted for about 3 seconds.  It was very loud.  Startled, I remember looking at my watch at the time and it was about 0230hrs.  After the whooping calls, I heard very faint distant calls or howling (not whooping).  The source of the scream was definitely coming further up valley I was camped in (maybe 200-300 meters away).  I stayed awake for a couple more hours in my tent and heard nothing more during the night.  I hiked alone for the three days, therefore no further calibration can be offered from another witness.  But I do find something interesting, the sound I heard was a very close match to the recordings of whooping sounds on this web sight.  Hope this small report helps.",
