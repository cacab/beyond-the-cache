  "observed": "I was 21 and had just returned about 6 months before from living in japan for 2 years. The general season mule deer hunt had just opened and i decided to go hunting one day after my college classes had ended, i remember thinking how stupid it was that i had to  go to class during the hunt and didn't want to while i driving/sliding my car up a snowy road. i turned off the paved road onto a farm road and went past a house that was under construction and parked in the small trailhead lot. instead of going up the mountain i walked a short distance around a field and sat down on a steep slope overlooking a valley, a few hills and some trees. i sat looking through my binoculars at the deer bedded down in the trees wondering why they wouldn't get up and forage in the trees for nuts or grasses. as i sat watching i heard a loud crashing sound coming from the trees nearer to the house/ barn that was being built, it may have even been watching them as it was very close to the house. i looked through my binoculars and could see a large black shape moving through heavy cover and at first thought it was a black bear but as i watched it didn't have the bouncing motion that bears have when they run because their front legs are shorter than the rear legs. it was moving very gracefully. i watched as it plowed through thick brush like a bull until it made it to more open ground in the trees and noticed how strange it really was. it was moving on two legs and moving fast. i looked and saw all the deer running. unfortunately it was in the other direction and turned back to the animal. i watched in amazement was it went straight into a massive stand of buck brush that i couldn't have gotten through with a machete. it kept moving at a phenomenal pace and was gone over a ridge in just a few seconds. i've hunted and hiked alone for years and come toe to toe with both black bears and mountain lions and never, ever been that afraid before. i imnedeiatly put a bullet into my rifle and backed away from the spot, never turning my back. i got in my car and left. my dad and brother and brother in law keep wanting to go back there because we've seen deer there but i have never gone back. even when i hunt the other end of the wellsville mountains i stay with someone because of the experience. z",
