  "title": "Man recalls childhood observation of rock throwing near Urichsville",

  "observed": "I grew up in Urichsville, OH right outside of town. I believe the rd was called water co. rd or something like that. Anyway up the hill there was a large unbroken tract of woods we used to play in. My friend and I were in the woods way down the road. It was definitely the more remote part. I remember there were farm fields across the road. On the far side of the hill was the Moravian trail. It must have been late summer the day wasn't overly hot and it was around four in the afternoon. I think i was about 9 yrs old so it would have been 1988. I know it's strange to be just now talking about but however minor it was it has been burned into my memory. We were hiking up from the road across from the farmers fields just exploring being kids when a rock hit a tree next to me and Luke. I looked up the hill and about 50 feet up the hill was what looked like a six foot tall black man but the thing about that scared the shit out of me and luke is that it was black all over and i mean black not brown black. I admit i only saw it for a second. It took off and we took off just as quick. At the time I had never heard of bigfoot and my child mind had to make sense of it somehow so we told our parents a black man threw rocks at us. I remember my dad called the farmer to tell him. The thing is there was one black kid in the whole town at that time. What I remember wasn't a man, I will say that. One other thing i remember is it seemed to be gauging our reaction maybe if we were a threat I remember its posture. It seemed to sway with it's shoulders forward when i saw it. We moved from Ohio when i was 11 I live in alaska now and i have never seen anything like it.",
