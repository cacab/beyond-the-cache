  "observed": "My son and I were heading home and about 100 feet in front of me I saw a dark colored figure in the road. I began to slow down as I got closer because I thought it was a person because it was standing upright walking across the road. As I got closer the figure moved faster across the road.  By the time I got 20 feet away, I saw a very tall figure covered in dark reddish-brown hair jump over the ditch, over a fence and take off through the field. He moved very fast across the field and into the woods.  I panicked and called my father to tell him what I saw and I drove home as fast as I could past the woods.  Two weeks later my dad saw the same type of figure I saw in the same woods at the same time of the day.  My brother told us several months later he saw the same figure in the same woods as well.",
