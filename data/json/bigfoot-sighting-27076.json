She has told me this amazing story several times before, and she is a very trustworthy person.  I strongly felt that this amazing encounter of hers should be reported, and she agreed.  As she told me, it was a very clear morning.  My Cousin was driving her and her younger Son to town on a narrow stretch of road near Gainsville, Florida, early one morning around 7:00 AM.  She may have been taking her Son to school but I cannot remember.  The narrow road she was on had swamps on both sides of it and looked messy.  As she was driving along all of a sudden a hairy upright creature walked right up out of the swamp on one side of the road and continued walking out in front of her car, and then it just stopped.  She immediately stopped the car just a few feet away from this thing not wanting to hit it, and just stared in shock at what she and her Son were seeing.  The \"manlike\" creature had stopped in the middle of the road and was turned around looking directly at them, and they got a very good look at the whole body of the creature.  The creature walked upright like a human with a gait and looked like a \"caveman,\" is the way she put it to me.  The creature had hair all over its body except for around the eyes, nose, and mouth of its face.  The most astonishing feature that she noticed though was that the creature was wearing some kind of \"animal skin\" for protection or something.  She was in shock.  This creature had to be intelligent to create and wear its own hand-made animal skin.  The creature showed no aggressive behavior, and after a couple of minutes or so just casually walked back into the swamp on the other side of the road.  The thing looked half human and half ape!  The creature was about 7-8 feet tall as well.  When she got home she told her Husband what had happened, and at first he didn't believe her.  For further reference I can give you my telephone number so you can contact her in Florida.  I am a true mystery writer, and just had to share this amazing story with you.  I do know that these amazing creatures really do exist!",
