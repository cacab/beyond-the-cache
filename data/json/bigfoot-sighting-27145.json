  "observed": "While archeery hunting in the Camp Blanding WMA Block C I heard a loud growling grunting sound as  I was walking on Sapp road toward my truck . I was about 300 yds from county route 100 when I heard the noise. It was unlike any animal sound  I have ever heard. I have been a hunter and outdoorsman since my youth so for about 40 yearsI have been hunting from Pa. to florida and never experienced any thing like this  . I have heard Bobcats and hogs  but this was very different than thooses type of vocalizations",
