  "observed": "About a year ago, I was coming home from taking my grandmother to work.  We lived on a paved but heavily wooded road. There are numerous ponds and fields surrounding the area.  As came across the final curve in the road, something caught my eye.  Just on the inside of the ditch by the pond before my house stood a figure.  At first glance I would have thought my eyes to be playing tricks. I slowed down and stopped fearing that I was going to hit a large animal.  I seen this tall figure (roughly 6 feet to 7 feet in height)turn and stare at my headlights.  It was Auburn-Brown and had very wirey hair.  Its head was kinda of oblong like that of monkey.  The face was flat other than the wierd looking nose (looked like a squished pig nose).  Its eyes glowed red in the headlights.  Once I stopped, it immediately turned and crouched into the ditch below.  I was so scared of being attacked that I drove the half mile home, ran inside and told my parents all about it.",
