  "observed": "I was either a freshman or sophmore in high school (I graduated in 86). It was about 7:30am and I was waiting for the bus stop (we lived on the corner of a dead end road at the top of a hill across the road was nothing but woods and logging roads. If you keep going straight it goes downhill on a gravel road and there were two trailers back there at the top of the hill. Our creek ran under the road at the bottom). I was waiting for the bus and was looking down the gravel road because there was light and I was a little nervous waiting and I saw something cross the road in one step where the creek runs under the road. The road is big enough for two cars to pass by each other. Whatever it was big and, no, it wasn't a bear; I had seen bears in zoos before and it wasn't any animal that I had seen before. I got scared and went back to the house and turned on the lights. I did not tell anyone about this. But there were always feelings when we were out in the woods that something was watching us. I don't ever remember hearing any screams or anything but we were fairly quiet people, those of us who lived on the road and at times it stunk; we were told we had skunk weed growing down at the creek. the kids always talked how Bigfoot lived on Bells Mountain. That wasn't too far away as the crow flies",
