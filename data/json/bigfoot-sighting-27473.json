  "observed": "Me and a friend borrowed another friends truck, skipped school and went bass fishing.It was about 3:00 in the afternoon when we decided to head home.We were driving down a gravel road that connected with the main line logging road. As we approached the main line road we noticed this creature to the right.It was about 80 yards away,and it started moving away from us very fast.The creature disappeared around a bend in the road about 125yards away.We sat there for a half a minute looking at each other in disbelief.Then we took off down toward where he went around the bend.When we got there the creature was about 200 yards down the road.It looked back towards us and went into the brush.When we got down there we shut the truck off and could hear rustling brush for about 20 seconds,but we couldn't see it.That was that.I grew up my whole life out in the woods,hunting, fishing,and hiking.I know all the animals in the area well,we know what we saw.It was unbelievable,we were close enough to get a good look at it.I was 18 at the time,now Im 36 and i can still see its face,its body,and its walk.The creature was at least 7'-8' tall,with long brownish red hair.It was a sasquatch,for sure.We never really talked about it to many people.All i know is these things are out there.",
