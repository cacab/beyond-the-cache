  "observed": "It was around the year of 1990 or so. I was about 10 years old and i was outside playing with my dog and the area behind her pen was very wooded at the time and as i looked up behind the pen, there was a very large creature standing right at the back of the fence of her pen. It stood there staring at me. It was solid white and had long hair covering it's body. It stood to be about 7 to 9 feet tall as i can remember, judging now by the trees and fence. As i seen this, i turned and started running down the hill in our yard and my brother was putting a radio in his car and he said that i was as pale as a ghost when he seen me. I was very scared, not knowing what this thing was. When he looked where it was, it was no longer there.",
