  "observed": "well me and my cousin were deep in the woods deer hunting close to our little camp site when we heard some very loud popping sounds maybe 35 yards away, we froze, tried to figure out the sound but couldnt. We started walking it was getting late almost dark we started to smell something. It smelled awful deader than dead my cousin hears something walking heavy, we turn around look down the logging road and see this thing step out of the treeline, it was a good 40 to 45 yards away it had dark brown hair, walked on two legs was very big 9 to 10 feet tall and it just stood there. Out of being so scared we couldnt move either, I couldn't of shot it if I wanted to but we stared at each other for about 3 or 4 mins and when it took a step into the woods we ran. 1st time ever saw anything like that. I told some people but they laughed and asked me how much I had been drinking but I dont drink so I saw the sight and decided to get this off my chest. I've been holding for years and I havn't been deer hunting that far in the woods since.",
