  "observed": "My husband and I have lived in Charlotte County FL our entire lives. We have camped with our families for over 40 years up the peace river (only accessable by boat) into Desoto county...After Hurrician Charley, We had gone early to set camp and meet friends.  Later that evening, we heard an undescribable screem/yell/growl from somethin very big.  Because of the number of alligators there, I at first thought an animal was getting bitten and dragged into the water as we heard water splashing and the yell continued and went from sounding hurt and suprised to angry and mad  (I had heard for a long time that there was a big foot in that area, but have never heard, smelled, or seen anything...well into our 40's we never thought we would.)  The yell lasted approx 5 seconds, going from something sounding like it was hurt fighting and then angry.  It made our hair stand strait up.  My husband immediately retrieved his gun, and we were very uncomfortable all evening.  We have never heard anything like this before...until...we watched a special on bigfoot and the gentleman from florida stated he had audio.  When we heard the audio, we both jumped to our feet in shock, as it was the same type of yell we had heard up river...It is a sound you would never forget.",
