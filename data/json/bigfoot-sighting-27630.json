  "observed": "I was out looking for deer with my mother and sister, We would drive the back roads and check certain fields and roadways and keep count of the deer.At the time the area was still mostly wilderness. My mother was driving this night and I was riding in the back seat, it was a warm night, we were riding with the windows down. As we pulled up to an intersection, we had to stop at a stop sign while we were stopped I looked over to the right and noticed a big brown animal about 10 yards away it looked to be about 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall. I could not identify the animal, I knew it was not a bear. While I was looking at it I was surprised when it stood up. I would estimate that it was over 8 feet tall, I rolled my window up right away because the animal was just standing there looking at us.As we contiued down the road my mother asked what I thought the animal was. I said what animal, at the time I was unaware that they had also seen it.My mother said the animal that caused me to roll up my window.",
