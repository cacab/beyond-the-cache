  "observed": "Can't remember exactly when it was but it was sometime in the mid-90's over in the far western portion of Anne Arundel County - Laurel to be exact where 3 counties come together - Anne Arundel, Howard, and Prince Georges.  We lived up off of Brock Bridge Road parallel to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and one evening out with the dog out back - our home backed up to woods - I hear a rustling noise behind what was a drainage pond for our community. It was summer and the sun was getting ready to go down so it was dusk-like -- I turned - and by the way so did the dog - our Labrador Retriever -  and could not believe my eyes. I observed a large - I am guessing 10-11 feet high - ape-like figure stalking in the woods behind the pond - I would say it was about 100 yards away.  I just froze - and so did our dog.  No one else witnessed this and we just both stood there for what seemed like 2 minutes - until the creature turned and looked our way and then slowly turned and dashed back off in to the woods....never to be seen again.  I remember this like it was yesterday but did not know about this site until today when my awesome nephew, AB, told me about  it.....so....here I am today...reporting this incident so everyone can be aware and know the truth.",
