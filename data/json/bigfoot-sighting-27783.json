  "observed": "Late at night just before bedtime while camping.  Extremely quiet, no hint of it approaching camp, we all jumped up and ran after the loud roar.  I don't remember anything after that or even exchanging story with my kids until recently. We still avoid talking about that night. I can't stop thinking about that night!",
