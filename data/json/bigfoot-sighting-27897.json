  "observed": "After reading the incodent that happened to the four hunters in Kid Valley Toutle area, I feel I have to describe my encounter with what I thought was a Bigfoot in 1980 when my family and I had just moved here from California. We live in Winlock Lewis County  off of the Hart Rd.  Back in 1980 our property and the surrounding acres were undeveloped and just Fir trees , Cedar trees, and lots of scrub brush .  Also there is a swamp at the end of our driveway.  My family owns fifteen acres .  Anyway our driveway ran half a mile right next to the pipeline and there was thick brush and trees on either side of it.  One day about 5 pm after school I was walking up our driveway and I heard something in the brush just off to my left.  I had seen deer, rabbits , porcipines, possums,and whylee .  But this was different.  This creature was walking just off my left side and staying with me, the faster I walked, the faster it walked.  You could tell it was a bi-pedal creature by the way it was walking.  As I got closer to the last 100yrds it stayed back and then it was gone.  That night my sister and I were sleeping in our half built home in sleepig bags on the floor.  About 2am this sound came from the woods behind our home that was like a Ape (it was a woop-woop, kind of sound) only so loud and unlike anything Ive ever heard before. Then ofter the woops- I we heard this long drawn out wailing cry, that was sad sounding to me. Considering what had happened to me during the previous day, I have to think they are conected.  Since that day and that night I never heard the sound again, nor has anything ever followed me like that , up or down the driveway.  I almost think whatever it was , was upset we were developing that property.  I have hunted and fished my whole life and never have heard or seen the trees bend right next to me as something walked with two legs right next to me , yet unseen.  Nor have I heard the sounds of that night. I have seen all the animals that live here and I have photographed and hunted them all.  I am 43  now  and have no reason to bring this up.  The only reason I am is so maybe others will realize what is happening to them when something like this happens.  I knew what it was yet I was 14 yrs old  and my parents would of laughed it off as nothing.  To this day I know that Bigfoot followed me up my driveway and then Bigfoot let me know what he was by the calls in the middle of the same night.  If you heard these sounds you would of thought the woops where a Orangatang swinging in the trees, until you heard the deep hollow crys after.  These are what sold me.  That cry is definately only made by The big guy himself. Thanks for your time.  Hunters be aware of what is all around you and what could happen to you. Thankyou, and enjoy the great wildrness we are priveledged to live next to. The area the four hunters experienced their encounter was right above the Green River Hatchery and I have frequented that log rd many times.  I know it like the back of my hand.  As I read the documentation of what happened it gave me chills .  Thankyou for believing in the truth and what is really out there. Karin",
