  "observed": "I was sitting at Popular Crove Church waiting on my girlfriends parents to go to work so I could see her. I started walking up the dirt road then I cut up on Roten Creek Road still walking on a dirt road. When I was walking I had a funny feeling and the hair on my neck and arms stood up. I passed by a local old lady's house, and saw car lights coming down the road from a distance so I ran down, to my left, and into the corn field. I squatted down and was waiting for the set of lights to come down the road, and as they passed, I saw another set of lights coming down the road, which was my girlfriends parents leaving. I was still squatting when I smelt a sudden (bad) odor (like mildew). I looked to the left then I looked to the right and I didn't see anything til I looked directly behind me. At the edge of the mountain where the cornfield began, there Bigfoot stood about 30 to 40 feet away from me. He was starring at me with big dark eyes. He had an oval pointed head. I'd say about 6-8 foot tall and as wide as a refrigerator. His arms were down beside him. He had big fingers, and hair 4 or 5 inches long all over his body. He had a bow in his back. He just stood there. He didn't show any teeth or anything. I remember trying to get my legs to start running but it was like I was frozen. It took me about 10 seconds to start running (NOTE: there was lights coming down the dirt road the whole time all of this was going on but we were both out of sight.) I started running. I ran into a barb wire fence getting to the road, then went running up the road hollering. I told my girlfriend about it and told her not to tell anybody. This has haunted me for years but I know for a fact that if he wanted to hurt me he could have.",
