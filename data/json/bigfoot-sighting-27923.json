  "observed": "Myself and my 7 year old grand daughter were out checking out some of the reported sigthings in the pierce county area.These sightings were a couple years old. The report #20591 is the site where we encountered vocals if thats what you want to call it, I call it a bunch of screaming. Anyway, we turned right at the first baptist church and went down this gravel pot holed road, we went as far as we could which was 1/2 mile maybe. the road is blocked off by giant rocks so we parked there got out walked straight down the road followed it for an hour or so anyway we seen a not trespassing sign posted up in a tree we were trying to make it to the river guess u cant get there anymore. we did see a green van parked down the road also, so we headed back to the truck. after getting back to the truck I was thinking about leaving the area but noticed another road across this small creek that ran along side of the road rite where the truck was parked. we crossed it went threw the area where the big pipes are and turn right followed the road which turns in to a path i'd call it anyway we got about 100 feet, i heard what i thought was a gruggling sound i stopped and i also noticed i did hear birds everything went dead quiet then I heard a faint little whine. Then the screaming started behind us. from where we came from on top of the hill to the left of where we came down the path about 50 yards back in dense brush area. something was screaming then I heard another something start screaming i thought OMG!! their are two holy crap!! we tried to quietly make our way back to the top of the hill, at the same time i could hear them moving towards us through the brush and they were still screaming I had positioned myself above the area i thought I could get a good picture of them if they came out of the brush into this small clearing it was perfect wind was towards us so i know they didnt get wind of us. we hiding behind a tree. My grand daughter was really getting scared at this point and made noise and they went quiet stopped and i heard them move away from us threw the brush on to the road to our left and they disappeared, gone that quick i searched the area where i thought they were for prints nothing but smashed down grass and some broken branches. I am experienced hunter from way back and heard all the animals in the forest except these guys!! Their screams scared me too along with my grand daughter. And yes I was Armed, anyway we got in the truck and went home we live in Graham.",
