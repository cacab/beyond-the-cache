  "observed": "In 1983 I was 14 years old and had the bright idea to make money by collecting mistle toe and with the help of my brother and 2 friends process and package the plants. First we had to find some so off we went to an area where we had never gone sense we moved to the area in 1979. When we arrived in the area in question it was around 330pm it was an average late november day in kentucky. Conditions were over cast, cold (40-50),and dry. As we made our way into and through the woods we found a logging road. the road was around 300 yrds in the woods and a dividing line between the two tree types. Once on the logging road we turned to the east and started up the road. After about 40-50 yrds or so we noticed several cows running about in the woods and a bull standing in the road just ahead. the bull kept looking to his right, our left at a large tree that was about 20 ft off the road. There were some smaller trees and cedar trees also from the road to the much larger tree that was about 4ft wide at the base. When we were in line with the tree we looked where the bull was still looking when we saw what was very clearly a very large bipedal creature with light brown hair from head to toe. I couldnt make out any facial features and the creature made no sounds even when I shouted bigfoot and the 4 of us ran directly to the south out of the woods which was around 300 yrds. We never went back there again and I have only told 1 other person about my encounter. I can honestly say that even with the training I had in the millitary and with law enforcement I would not go back there even if i were armed!",
