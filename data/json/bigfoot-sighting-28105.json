  "observed": "I was fishing on a boat at Lake Kanawauke at 9:20pm on August 10, 2010. We where heading to dock the boat. We heard and seen a big splash we thought it was people. So we asked them to stop but nobody responded we proceeded to head into shore when we noticed another big splash. So then we stopped and we noticed a foul smell, like a wet animal. We then looked towards the bushes and a tall thin tree was shaking very fast back and forth. Then we noticed a big bolder thrown through the air toward us, it hit the water. That's when we realized what the splashing was.Then we noticed a man like figure with red beady eyes when we flashed the light at the bushes about 2 feet above the bushes was the eyes. So we started to bang the boat with the oars to scare away whatever this was.Then we heard a loud scream as we loaded the boat on the truck and left.",
