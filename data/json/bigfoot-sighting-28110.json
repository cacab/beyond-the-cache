  "observed": "I was out late one night cat fishing at Clinton Lake by myself. I had been there for probably a couple hours and hadn't really been catching much. I had talked to a few people who were coming in on boats and seen a few going out. It seemed like a normal night for the most part. About an hour after I had seen the last person left, I was starting to get the feeling I was being watched. I shrugged it off because I know there are raccoons, possums, coyotes, even stray dogs and cats. So I dismiss it and resume my fishing. After awhile I notice how quiet it is. All I can hear is the faint breeze and the water lapping on the boat ramp where im sitting. Right about now I'm starting to get spooked. I know when there's a predator of some kind around that this usually happens. I'm an avid duck hunter, and a die hard cat fisherman, so I'm used to traipsing around in the dark. I figure its just a coyote eyeballing me so I get my flashlight and get up to take a look around. I look around for a bit and don't see anything. I once again put this out of my head, starting to think I'm losing my mind. After a little while longer I still notice there isn't any sound. As I'm sitting there staring across the lake, the hair on my arms and neck starts to stand up. I don't really spook that easy but when the hair stands up, something is watching you. I decided that I had all I could stand and threw all my stuff in my truck and left. On my way home I called dad and told him what was going on. He told me back in the  70's, there was sightings of what the town called the Salt Creek monster. I'm no skeptic, but at the same time I haven't ever seen it. After a while he tells me I should go back and check the place out a little more closely. I decided it was probably a good idea just for some peace of mind. I drive back out to the boat launch, and park in the parking lot. I have the truck lights on as well as my flashlight that I'm scanning the area with. After about 15 minutes I give up and go to leave. As I'm turning around in the parking lot, the truck lights pick something up standing in the trees. I immediately stomp on the brakes. About 20 yards away I'm looking at something that's probably seven feet tall, not overly muscular but it was covered in  black hair. It also had a big pair of yellow eyes.    It had a deer in the head lights look about it and it tore off running through the trees along the lake. I had been in track in high school and this easily outpaced the fastest runners I'd ever seen. When it ran it didn't pump its arms. They just swayed a bit. Before I really understood what I was seeing it was gone. I drove my little truck as fast as it could go all the way home. I called my dad back and remember being on the edge of hysteria. After that I always had my gun in the truck, which was always within sprinting distance of where I was fishing.",
