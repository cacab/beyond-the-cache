  "observed": "I don’t know where to begin with this, other than to apologize for this being such an old story. I hope that it isn’t useless to you. I guess I need to tell you about the area I lived in first before I start into the rest of the story because there is a lot to it, and I think it will be confusing if I just stumble into it. In Washington state there is a town called Morton. It is an old logging community and it has a population of around 1500. It is surrounded on all four sides by mountains, and is located along highway 12, about 45 minutes east of Interstate 5 past Mayfield lake and north of rife lake. The town is only about 1 square mile in all and when you look at road maps it is truly in the middle of freakin’ no where. In fact, it is about 2 miles south of the southeastern tip of the Snoqualmie national forest. When I lived there though I was 11 years old and I didn’t know any of that. I only bring it up now because this asks for information on the area and how to get there. I lived on 7th street. When you look at the map it is the very first street you come to when traveling east along highway 12, and we were the third house from the highway. Directly across from my house is the Graveyard. It isn’t well lit, but there are a few lights, a lot of shrubs, and a few huge trees, as well as a huge hedge wall along the right side of it, when looking at it from my house.  On the other side of the hedge is the power plant, and it is super well lit. There are light posts all over and you can see everything over there. To the left when looking out my window is highway 12, and there is a large hill directly on the other side of the highway. It hadn’t been logged when I saw this, but the next year they did some stuff up there. That’s probably not important, but anyway… to the meat of this whole thing… Like I said I was 11 or so. My family had moved up from California for work and we took the first place we could get. I’m not going to lie the place was a piece of junk. It was drafty and poorly insulated, and whoever lived there before must have had 100 cats they let pee everywhere because it stunk too. It has since been re built a bit but at the time it was a little blue shack that didn’t have a bedroom because it had burnt down before we bought it. Because of that I slept on the couch, and my brother slept in the reclining chair. it’s the north window of the house that I slept next too, facing the street, and I used to sit there at night looking out the window at the stars and hoping deer would come eat my neighbors flowers so I could see one up close. Most people in morton are older, and all my neighbors were elderly… the town has the only local hospital so a lot of older folks live there. Anyway, she always complained about the dear eating her roses or something, and I just wanted to see the stupid deer. Having come from Cali, I’d never seen one in real life. So there I was, laying on the couch propped up with my head peeping out from under the curtain waiting for deer. It was a towel actually, we didn’t have curtains, but it worked just as well I guess. The towel left about a 4 inch gap at the bottom before the sill where you could see outside without moving the curtain at all. Most nights nothing happened, and it became a habit for me to just look outside. We didn’t have cable TV or anything, just the videos my uncle would send us of shows he’d recorded, and I couldn’t read a book because my brother got mad if the lights were on, so it was the only way I could wind down before I went to bed. Most days I didn’t see anything but starts, but one day I saw a deer chillin out there eating grass or something, and I just thought it was the coolest darn thing ever! I watched it for a long time as it just kinda walked around and… ate stuff, I guess. Having seen hundreds of deer since then I kinda laugh thinking about it but MAN was it ever cool at the time. So I’m sitting there, watching the deer, and all of a sudden it sticks its head strait up in the air and looks behind it and freezes. Then it took off running, veering left and right and changing directions, but I couldn’t see what was chasing it at first, until it ran back towards the mortuary where there is actually some light and then I was even more awestruck because it looked like a bear was chasing it! It was this big, thick, kinda fat looking thing, running on all fours and I couldn’t see a tail so I figured it couldn’t be a wolf, but man was it ever fast! It was so cool! I never knew bears could run fast and I’d certainly never seen one before, and then the deer ran behind the mortuary, around the other side, and back towards my house with the bear right behind it. The bear was catching up, but then the deer ran right into the road and ran around the hedge into the power plant area, where it just stopped and stood there in the light. The bear didn’t follow it, and kinda hung out in the shadows for a while. I could see it moving around but it was all dark. Maybe a minute went by and then the bear walked back towards highway 12 real slow, just taking its time. Well, there was a little ditch before the highway, and then the guard rail… and I was watching it walk over it, and that’s when it stood up. It just stood up and walked over it, walked across the road on two legs, stepped over the other guard raid, and went up into the hill across from the highway. I had NO idea what to make of it. I knew bears could stand up on two legs but I knew they couldn’t walk like that... I mean it just walked right like I would have. I never told anyone about it because I thought I’d get in trouble. I had gone to a private Christian school in Cali and so making up stories got you in trouble, and I really didn’t want to get detention.  I never told that story to anyone as a “real” story I should say… I have always told my friends its A “monster story” and added stuff about huge fangs and stupid stuff because I just needed to get it OUT, you know?  But I didn’t want people to think I was crazy… I was trying to fit in to a new school… Later in the year I was watching a tape my uncle had sent to us and a comercial for burger king 99 cent whoppers came on. I thought it was stupid because there were no burger kings here, so I muted it and turned my head towards the window. When I looked out the window I saw a pair of eyes looking back at me, glowing from the light of the TV. I was scared and threw my blanket over my head and held absolutely still. I could hear something running away from the window, but I think that may have just been a curious couger… Everything ive read about bigfoots, since someone finally told me about them the year after I saw the thing chase the deer in the graveyard, has said that they are very shy and wouldn’t come up to a house like that. Anyway, that’s my two stories. I hope they are somehow helpful. I also hope maybe you can give me some insight? I really don’t know what I saw still, but the only thing that makes sense anymore is if it were a Bigfoot.",
