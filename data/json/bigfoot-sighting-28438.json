  "observed": "up hunting on road 1855 above Darrington, WA. Friday Oct.22 2010. mid day, 4200 ft.elv. We were at the end of the road on top of a ridge, my buddy was checking out a steep canyon on one side of the ridge and I hiked down about 40 yrds. down the other side (east). I was just looking around for deer or bear, this area is well known for black bear, one had been shot a week before in this area. I heard some branches breaking down from me about 100 yrds. so I started watching in the direction of the noise. I saw a few tree branches moving, not like from wind and all of a sudden I saw what looked like a brownish/black shoulder and head of something, I don't know for sure what it was but I know that I've been in the woods a lot in my 51 years and nothing ever before made the hair on my neck stand up in the woods like it did that day. Also there was a faint odor of rotten meat or rotten trash??? I'm not sure if it was a bigfoot or not but it might be worth checking out. We were only there for about 15 minutes as it was starting to rain hard and the clouds were moving in and we couldn't see for hunting.",
