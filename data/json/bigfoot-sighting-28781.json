  "observed": "My son and I were heading north on hiway 109 just north of Moclips, WA.  We were in my pick-up truck and I was driving. It was cloudy, but no rain.  The sun had just set but there was still plenty of light.  109 is a two lane road along the ocean and there wasn’t any other traffic, so I was driving sort of slow and enjoying the nice summer evening.  As I was driving, I was enjoying the view to my left and just caught a glimpse of a decent sized animal that darted from right to left across the road and into the left ditch, where I lost sight of it as I drove past.  As I drove I continued to look to my left to take in the view when movement near the road ditch to the left side of my truck caught my attention.  I turned my head to look out the driver’s window and saw some sort of animal running on all fours in the ditch to the left beside the back of the truck about 25 feet away.  It was easily keeping up with the truck as I drove about 35 mph.  My mind couldn’t identify what sort of animal it was so after a quick look at the road I looked at the animal again.  My instant reaction was that the animal looked like an ape based on how it was built and how it was moving.  I’m no ape expert, but I’ve seen them in the movies and TV and that’s what it looked like.  After another quick look at the road, I turned to view the animal again but it was gone. We saw it for maybe 10-15 seconds.  It was about 3 feet tall as it ran on all fours, stocky and thick with a dark brownish color.  It had hair/fur of a uniform length of about 3 inches all over.  One of the reasons it reminded me of an ape so much was the way it’s front legs were longer than it’s back legs making it’s hind end lower than it’s front end as it ran.  Because I could only get short looks at the animal as I was also driving, the face was all a blur and I didn’t see any details.  I’ve been in the woods and outdoors all my life working, hunting and playing in Washington and Alaska and I’ve seen many animals and this was like nothing I’d ever seen before.  After the sighting, my son and I drove to a restaurant and tried to make sense of what we saw, but couldn’t.  I’d filed it away as a mystery until my cousin told me recently that its believed sasquatch young run on all fours and it suddenly made sense.",
