  "observed": "it was the winter of 97. shotgun season for deer. i gotten into the woods half hour before sunrise. i decided to sit up against a tree in a little ravine. . i was facing east towards a half destroyed bridge. i sat there for a few and i nodded off.  i heard a twig snapped i slowly raised my head thinking it was a deer. but instead there was something walking along a trail that goes to the wash out bridge. at my guess it seem to be at least 9ft tall i say i was about 100yds away. i saw outline figure very well. i just froze got goose bumps all over and the back of my hair stood up. it had a very long stride walk and slumped over as it walked. when it aproach the bridge it didnt miss a step when got across. ive been on that bridge and i know i have to jump across and still i wouldnt make it across. when it disappeared i thought it was another hunter so i just let it go. until i got to my truck and i realized that i was the only hunter there and that figure i saw wasnt wearing hunter orange during shotgun season. thats when it hit me",
