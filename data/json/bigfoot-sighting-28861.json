  "observed": "hey i just happened to stumble upon this website. last year october 24 2009, me, my friend, and his dad where waterfowl hunting on monroe lake, in monroe county, we were set up on a peninsula on the farthest point with two small bays behind us to our right and left. we have gone to the peninsula before multiple times to waterfowl hunt.and we went out early morning when it was still dark. everything was normal. no birds flying though. so we were just stitting on our colapsable chairs facing the water looking by this time it was about 5 mins. after sunrise so still pretty dark. it was my friend on my right and his dad on my left, since we were shooting shot guns they were loud so i had ear plugs in. and then this extremely loud roar/ moan comes from the right bay. the moment i heard it i though it was a dog.. but it kept going and got even louder and then dropped to a very low moan/ growl . the roar / moan lasted about 8 to 10 seconds, keep in mind i had ear plugs in and i still heard that noise crystal clear. we all three stood up and just stood facing the other side of the right bay and didnt see anything ( only a beaver in the middle of the bay. the bay was about 60 yards across. me and my friend were terrified and had no idea what made that noise. not paying attention to hunting we stood there scared to death. now i need to ephasize the loudness of the roar it was extrememly extremely loud. and i looked over to my friend about 2 mins after the first noise. and i said man i wish we could hear it again. what do you know . we hear it again but it sounded much farther away. and sounded the exact same as the first noise. we were shocked . now us being hunters we knew just about any indiana wildlife there is to know about and all the noises they make. and what we heard that day was nothing like i have ever heard in my life. so then not hunting any longer we remainded standing there facing the right bay listening. we dont hear anything else. we didnt see and birds flying that whole morning so about 12 noon we pack up and start to walk back to where our car was parked about a 5 min walk with the gear so about 300 yards away. the path we took that morning was on the bank of the right bay... as you would think we kept our shot guns loaded on our walk back to the car.we pack up and get on our way. the spot we where in was not very populated at all there was a dnr check station about a mile down the road and some houses on the windie road back to bloomington. now if you know any thing about monroe are is how hilly it is and the questions we kept asking our selves was , what was that noise...? and how could if have traveled so quick to hear agian so far away? our gueses we made where - bared owl?, mule deer? dog? some sort of bear..? but we all quickly ruled out of the those. the closest was the dog. but the roar/ moan was so loud and the last 3 sec dropped to a low low growl/ mumble and no dog could make that loud of a howl of any sort. it wasnt till about half way through the 2 hour drive home to indianapolis. that my friends dad said it could have been some college kids joking around  since it was around halloweenwith a mega phone. but then we said why would college kids be up at 630 go deep into monroe forest find 3 hunters in complete camoflauge and make that noise. just none of our guesses were making sinse with that noise we heard. its not till we got back to my friends house and got on the computer and immedialely started looking up moans and roars. none matched we tried every animal noise in indiana and then we were on youtube and a video popped up . the title said bigfoot noises and pictures . thats when me and my friend look at each other and said oh my god . quickly clicking on the video a picture of so called \"big foot' showed up and then a audio started. the noise on the video was EXACTILY the same noise we hear that morning hunting. then we go to another bigfoot recording . it was very similiar to what we heard, and another and another and all the videos we listnend to matched up just right with what we heard or very close to what we heard. now before this incedent we would always make fun of the bigfoot tv shows and the people who believe in big foot. but i do not  make fun of that any more. me and my friend still talk about it today about what we heard on october 22 2009. me and my friend are both believers of big foot. or not big foot but some unknown creature that is out there and no one can seem to pin point what it is so they use the name \"bigfoot\" we never did go back to the peninsula on monroe lake that hunting year. but we did go back in october again this year to the same exact spot. we didnt hear anything but that time we didnt go back to the spot across the right bay to where we heard it and found no sign of anything out of the ordianry. it still remains a mystery of could have made that noise but as of now me and my friend both say what we heard was bigfoot. all i have said is completely true. i hope this was worth reading if you have any questions or comments on this my email is [removed] ( i would actually like if you did respond to this so i can hear what you guys have to say about my story) thanks",
