  "observed": "The age here is 75 but I remember my first encounter vary well. It was in the summer of 1944, I was 9yrs old. It occurred in Alger co. Mich. near a post office called Eben Jct. It was at my grandfathers farm which was on the edge of The Hiawatha Natl.Forrest. My mother and Aunt were pulling Rhubarb from a patch next to the woods. My male cousin and I ran off in the woods to play a favorite game-This is the kicker--We would take small dead second growth trees and whack them against live bigger trees trying to hit each other with pieces that flew off. After doing this for some time we stopped and looked around for some reason.The opposite side of the wood lot was not vary far away and the sun was bright. What we saw was a huge man standing broad side to us looking at us. He was huge and as we looked he turned and walked away. We flew out of the woods and told our mothers but they just said it was the neighbor man. Well it was not a man. We never went into that section of woods again. Did our knocking on trees draw him in?.I duno-",
