  "observed": "My dad and I were heading for Taylorville from Morrisonville when we came over a small hill. My dad started to hyperventilate and was starring at something up ahead. I looked back up the road and there was a very tall upright animal walking across the road, stepped over the guard rail and disappeared underneath the bridge. Just that fast it was gone, and we didn't see it again. I had an appointment at noon so I know this was maybe 10 minutes before then. It is just two miles from Taylorville where the bridge goes over the South Fork of the Sangamon River. I had my dog with me also and he had his head out the window and was acting up by what he was smelling.",
