  "observed": "Now I work at night and I travel across the River Rd to Marseilles the next town to the west. The night of February 24th at or around 3 am while coming home, at the base of the new bridge to the south of the new intersection while making my turn with my bright lights in my 4x4 GMC Yukon (I mention this because it sets higher than an average car). I came around to the stop sign and across the field at fifty yards at a semi-fast pace a large humanoid subject was observed moving east of myself and another individual who was traveling on Dupont Rd. The other driver stopped and asked me if I had seen a bear running just then and I responded that I didn't think it was a bear. He chuckled made a bigfoot reference and drove off. No name, no idea who he may be. I figured it was time for me to report it to maybe put some validity to the rumors and legends.",
