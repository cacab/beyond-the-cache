  "observed": "I have two personal accounts and at least one second hand accounts to report. I was encouraged to share them by a recent aquaintance, Nate H. I would like to be contacted by phone at your convenience to give a more detailed description of the encounters and specific locations. That said, I will briefly describe the incidents. All occurred in Ferry County, Wa. The first was back in the mid 80's. I was 20 or 21 and would pack in by myself on 3-4 day mule deer hunts in the high country. I was camped mid-mountain overlooking the Sherman Creek drainage. At dusk I heard a long \"howling\" call from far below me that literally caused my hair stand on end. It started very low and and cresendo'd at a medium level, lasting maybe ten seconds and repeating twice. Oooowwwwuuuuuuu. I have heard everything in the woods, including bull beef cattle, and I knew instinctually what this was. My remaining nights on that hunt were spent sleepless. I never spoke to anyone about it, fearing ridicule. Four years later I was stationed in SE Alaska and my father in law (an avid hunter) came up to go on a brown bear hunt with me. Late on the night after our life threatening kill of a dandy bruin, we were imbibing in some whiskey in our remote cabin. The comraderie of the hunt coupled with the whisky loosed our tongues and I told him of my experience years prior, with his promise of secrecy. With the same promise from me, he related an actual sighting he had not five miles from where I heard the \"call\" He was a UPS driver and his route took him over Sherman Pass on HWY 20 on a daily basis. It was early spring and he was just below the summit when he saw what appeared to be a long haired \"hippie with a backpack\" trucking through the tall brush up ahead on the west side of the HWY. He slowed down and as he came abreast of it (about 20 mph)their eyes met. It was instant recognition an the BF did a 90 down the hill. As to my knowledge, he has never told another soul. Jump ahead appx 20 years. My hunting partner and I were driving a remote section of road after dark to try and find concentrations of deer tracks to hunt some new areas about twenty miles from Canada and forty miles north of the aformentioned incidents. There was appx 16\" of snow and maybe 4\" of new over the last vehicle tracks. We came upon a strange set of extremely large tracks and got out to investigate, thinking they were cougar. However, these were unmistakably bi-ped, and HUGE!I wear size 13 and they were at least 4\" longer than my insulated boot footprint. In addition, the stride was so long that we had to jump to mimic the distance between them. The tracks followed the road for appx a mile, mainly holding to the \"uphill\" side of the road and sporadically moving to the downhill side when the view was more expansive. They finally dove off the road into a creekbottom and we couldn't locate where they exited the creek. Keep in mind that it is 10 degrees f so no human is gonna take a walk in a stream! I have an entry in Boone & Crocket, so I hope that lends some credibility to my assertions. I would love to speak with you via phone to give a more detailed description. ",
