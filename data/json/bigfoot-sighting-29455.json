  "observed": "Hello I am from rural South Dakota and i have a strange sighting that I saw about 6 years ago. I was Driving truck and this was about at 5 in the morning still dark in the fall of the year around the end of november. I come onto hwy 44 from 1806 and i turned east onto 44 about 2 miles from the platte-winner bridge on the missouri river. About 200 to 300 ft or so from when i turned there was a dark figure on the right hand side of the road crouching down. At first i thought it was a deer or a fabled moutian lion but it was too dark colored and the only thing that made me write this now was as i drove past it it stood up. this thing was tall enough to look into the top of the passengers side window of my straight truck. This would have made it a little over 7 feet tall. I have never said anything to anyone about this around here because no one would have beleived me. I have lived in this area my whole life and an avid hunter and fisherman, i have never seen anything like this.",
