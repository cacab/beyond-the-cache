  "observed": "I was out in the woods of Ashtabula County, Ohio in the Geneva area. I was picking up wood for a fire we were going to have at the neighbors house. I left my truck at the road, and walked into the woods to find some of the better wood and logs to use. I was coming out of the woods with some wood to put in the back of my truck, when a big hairy upright creature ran across the road and disappeared into the woods in four steps. I got in my truck and drove up there, turned my lights on where it went in to the woods, and I saw two yellow eyes glowing at me, and then they were gone. I'm 5'10 and the creature towered over me, I would say it was easily between 6'10\" and 7'4\". It was by far the scariest experience Ive ever had. As an avid hunter, I can tell you that I have never seen anything like this, and it was surely not a bear.",
