  "observed": "My Grandson (11 years old at the time) and I were hunting for deer in the back end of the Clay Bank swamp, this time on the north end of it, opposite of my earlier encounter, when it was getting twilight we decided to call it a day, picked up our equipment and started a slow walk back to my truck, only got about 50 yds when a 6 point buck ran within 20 feet to the front of us, and about 6 feet behind the deer was a sasquatch chasing him, it had its arms outstretched to grab the deer, it was black and in the 8 ft area, really big.  As the creature was directly in front of us it looked at us, it was as surprised as we were, the deer continued on to the south west, the creature headed south east at that point into the pines, hard woods, hemlock and ceders, it was out of sight in about 15 seconds, they seem to be able to hide from sight pretty easy.  My Grandson turned to me and said,\"Holy crap Grandpa did you see that big black thing?\" all I could say was \"yup\",  and again the safety was taken off on my rifle as we walked the rest of the way out.  My Grandson wanted to take a peek and see if we could see it again, but we didn't.  To the east south east of us is a clear cut field which is the direction it headed in, and to the east of us is a jackpine plantation.  I feel the creature only went as far as it needed to be out of our sight, and probably to continue his hunt for venison after we were gone.  We were back in the same spot the next morning at my Grandson's request, he was unafraid when he was with me, and against my better judgement we went back to same spot.",
