  "observed": "I was at Lake Elmer Thomas Recreational Area Otherwise known as LETRA, on Fort Sill Oklahoma, I had gone down to lake to show my wife where my friend and I used to go fishing. We parked on an inlet of land leading to a small island that could only be crossed through the water. I pointed to the west to give her a kind of an idea of where it was that my friend Lester and I used to drive down to reach a hidden peninsula where the bass were big. When i looked towards the area which is less than maybe half a mile away you could see the area behind our fishing spot which was just a hill in the wilderness. Thats when i saw a LARGE dark figure walking very fast. My estimations from the size of the creature to from where i was standing, it was probably somewhere around 7-8 feet tall. There is nothing but ranges and wilderness in that area.. there is no reason for anyone to be walking alone that far into wilderness of Fort Sill...my wife and I quickly left after what i witnessed.. to this day i still havent gone back to that fishing location in fear of what could possibly be there.",
