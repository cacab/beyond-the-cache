  "timestamp": 1309392000,
  "observed": "Gas well site. 6 tanks with loud compressors, a creek behind the tanks with houses everywhere. I had 2 lights on my tractor trailor and one on my hard hat so I can read gages. I start to grab my stuff and am almost to the steps. I seen eyes light up from my hard hat light. They were about 20 feet from the compressor steps, on the other side of the fence by the creek. Now I am a hog hunter, so I am used to seeing eyes until I was looking up at it. So I knew it was not a hog or a deer, or horse ,or cow. As it looked at me, and I stood there looking at it, it stepped out from behind a tree toward the fence. It looked at me, then turned so I could not see its eyes anymore, and it walked like a human into the creek. So I ran to my truck and called my boss. Now I am not scared of a man, but that was not a man.",
