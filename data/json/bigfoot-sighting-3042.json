  "observed": "traveling east on hwy I-40 around the town of Hydro Oklahoma ,i was a passanger, i saw a large black form come out of a tree line and walk down to the stream squat and scoop water with his hand. you would have to understand the layout of this stream,in this part of Oklahoma the soil is red in color, my view was clear and unobstructed. The creature was very large and very black.  The creatue I observed was not as ape like as seen on TV he was not short legged and big bellyed with dangle ape arms.  He was very tall with a longer torso than an ape, the arm were longer than a mans and the body was covered with very thick and black-black hair, i was struck by the ease inwhich he strooled form the treeline the blackness of the creatue and his size.  I don't even try to make anyone believe my story because I know what I saw! As does any one that has seen it! This not my first report but no one has ever contacted me.",
