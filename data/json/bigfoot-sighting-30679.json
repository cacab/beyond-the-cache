  "title": "Nighttime sighting by a motorist outside Port St. John",

  "observed": "I was driving down state road at 9pm on 9/17/11. This road is good for heavy traffic and none at all. At the time I was the only car on the road going both directions.  I was headed south towards state road 528. 407 runs adjacent to the Canaveral marsh lands full of deer, hogs, birds and plenty of other native wild life. at 9:10 or so I saw what appeared to be a skunk ape cross the road right in front of me.  This road fits one car in each direction. The skunk ape appeared to be running because it crossed the road in 2 step very easily. After the second step it jumped down into the side embankment and into the bushes next to the road.  I did get a good look at it since I driving at a pace to avoid hitting deer that cross the road frequently. The animal had long hair all over its body. Especially on the arms and shoulders. This is the reason I know it was in a sprint. The hair was flowing like it would if it was blowing in the wind. The color of the hair seemed to be dark. Reflecting against my head lights and the moon light I really couldn't tell the color. It had a cone shaped head, Very longs arms. When it jumped down into the embankment the arms went up in the air as to help keep its balance or not hit anything .  I saw the side profile of the face. The face was dark ( again night time ) it seemed ape like. The feet where huge. as it took steps I noticed how large they were.  The over all body seemed very THICK. The animal was very muscular. From the side view I had , you could see just how thick of a body it was. I didn't stop to investigate due to the face that it was night time and I did not want to have a face to face with what ever I saw alone on a dark road. Thinking about the situation as it constantly replayed in my mind . I think it might have been in pursuit of a deer. I constantly see deer on that road at night into the early morning. This was my first time seeing a skunk ape, but I have heard they were sighted some times in the area further south on state road 520. I feel with the rise in the deer population it might have moved into the area.",
