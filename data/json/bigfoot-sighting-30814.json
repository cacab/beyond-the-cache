  "observed": "I have two experiences about 30 years apart at the same location - my parents home in Pike County, Kentucky - that I have always wanted to talk about.  The first occurred around 1966 or 1967.  It was sometime during the winter months, I'm not sure exactly now.  We awoke one morning to a pretty good snow fall, 4-6 inches or so.  The unusual part was a huge number of large humanlike tracks behind our house in the snow coming from the hillside to our back yard right up to the house.  I remember my Mom and Dad talking about the tracks and showing them to me and my younger brother and Mom being afraid to let us go out and play in the snow for a long time after that.  We couldn't understand why or how a person could be out on that hillside in a snowstorm in the middle of the night. The hill is very steep in that area and it's not easy to climb under the best conditions.  Yet, these tracks led right down the hillside to our house very visible as far as we could see up the hill. The second event occurred in the very same location in the early to mid 90's.  I was home for a weekend visit in the late summer or early fall.  It was a beautiful, warm evening about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. and I was outside visiting with my Dad.  I was sitting in a swing beside the porch and Dad was sitting in a chair on the porch.  Suddenly, I stopped the swing because I could hear footsteps coming towards us from way up on the hill.  These sounded like a large human walking down the hill, not like a deer or any other 4 legged animal - very steady paced and coming straight down the hill.  The footsteps continued to get closer and louder until whatever it was got down to the treeline, where it stopped.  I think it either could see us or hear us by then and it stopped at that point. I could hear it shuffle around  for a few seconds, then it turned around and walked back up the hill exactly as it had come down.  I never saw any type of light, such as a flashlight nor heard any voice or other sound that indicated a human presence.  Like I said earlier, this hillside is VERY steep and is difficult to climb under any conditions.  Yet whatever this was climbed straight back up that hillside in the pitch dark without stopping to rest or change directions.  I could hear the same steady bipedal sounding footsteps in the leaves until they went out of earshot.  My dad, about 70 at the time, never heard anything. I grew up there and I don't know of any human being who could climb that hill in the dark without stopping at all.",
