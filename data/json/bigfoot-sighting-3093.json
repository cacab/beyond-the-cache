  "observed": "My husband was outside our apartment building on the outskirts of town, when he heard what seemed to be something very large and heavy running through our backyard by the fenceline. He came into the house and told me about it. About ten minutes later, I went outside, and I saw something that looked very large and hairy moving in the shadows in my barn. My three dogs were barking up a storm and suddenly stopped. I went back into the house. The next night, my husband heard it once again, but this time it was right outside our bedroom window. He saw a shadow move across outside, and our window is about 9 foot off the ground on the second story. He could see from it's shoulders up. It had a dome-like head. He then heard it make its way around the house torwards the bean field across the street. It let out a moan-like cry that just sent chills down his spine. The following two nights, us and a couple friends from out of town were outside playing hide-and-seek on our property when we heard strange noises again. My husband and his friend went to investigate the noises, and came running back to the house. It was only 50 yards away hiding between two large silos. It had goldish eyes that reflected light like a deer's. There seemed to be another one just like it only a little smaller with it the last night it was spotted. We've heard it every night for about 5 nights now, and have grown accustomed to hearing it and seeing it. It's not really frightening, but it is intimidating because of it's size and our lack of knowledge as to what exactly it is.",
