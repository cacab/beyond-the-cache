  "observed": "Fall 1983 My four friends and I were playing Chinese jump rope in their yard late one afternoon, just before evening.  My neighbor owned somewhere around 100 acres across the street and the five acre parcel we were playing on.  He owned a herd of buffalo and for some reason had one young buffalo alone on this parcel.  As my friends and I were playing, the buffalo caught our attention as it came running across the property.  I remember we all looked up at it and wondered why it could have acted so spooked. We went back to playing and a bit later one of my friends, the only boy, exclaimed “Did you guys see that?  There was a tall black thing on two legs that just jumped across the creek.”  We all looked out into the field, but did not see anything.  The rest of us told him to quite messing around, but he insisted he was serious.  We dismissed his claims and continued our game.  Since it wasn’t my turn, I kept scanning the field wondering what the boy may have seen.  I noticed a black stump under a tree, which I could not recall being there before.  I kept looking at it thinking is that a stump or something else?  The shape looked like a tall black figure standing upright, leaning forward with very long arms down to its knees.  The head was turned looking directly at us.  However it was so still I thought it had to be a burnt stump.  I felt it was looking directly at me but it did not move at all.  I kept my eyes fixed on it, but turned my head to make it look like I wasn’t watching it.  Immediately it began to run across the field.  It ran on two legs, had very long swinging arms and a flat face.  It was very tall and covered in black hair.    I yelled and everyone turned and started screaming.   Upon hearing our screams, it turned to look at us and immediately turned its direction and ran back up into the woods.   We were all very scared and ran into the house. My friend’s dad believed us as he said he had seen a bigfoot when they had lived in Moses Lake, WA.  I was so scared I called my parents next door and wanted them to come pick me up in their car.  My family dismissed our claims, but I know there is no way it was anything else but a bigfoot. The next day we went out in the field.  We could not find any footprints, but could see where something large ran through the tall grass.  Looking under the tree where I originally saw the “stump”, I estimate it was 7 feet tall based on a tree limb it was just beneath.  There was a deer path where we saw it enter the woods.  When we approached the path, my friend’s dog started growling, so we took off. The next school day we were riding the bus home.  I was excited to tell the other kids what we had witnessed.  Of course they all started to tease us, and the other kids which had witnessed the encounter quickly backed off our story and would never speak of it again. I am 100% positive we saw a bigfoot that day.  No other animal could run on two legs with arms swinging the way this did.  Its face was flat, so in no way could have been a bear.  It was too big and moved differently than a human.   Based on the way it watched us, and waited until it thought we were not looking at it, I believe it’s an intelligent creature.  I think we have them around us a lot more than we will ever know.  I have had other experiences where I may have heard vocalizations, wood knocking and possibly have smelled it, but do not know for sure.  I also know there are a lot more people who have witnessed similar events, but never report it.  I laugh at the naive that do not believe as I know the truth.",
