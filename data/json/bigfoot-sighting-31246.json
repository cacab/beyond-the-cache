  "observed": "Going fishing last year at Mogadore Reservoir off Ranfield rd. Late night around 1am in the morning we had caught a couple of catfish. A 7lb and a 15lb. My truck was parked roughly 20ft behind us. Throughout the night I heard tree knocks and calls not common to the area. When we heard a few getting closer we decided to leave. When i went to the back of the truck where we kept our gear and the fish the 7lb catfish was gone. We looked around the truck and area to see if it had hopped out and saw nothing. While searching my partner was hit on the chest with a small rock leaving a half dollar sized mark. We packed up and left fast since we felt very scared at that point. I came back to the location a a couple of times since then and noticed trails and branches that were twisted and snapped that couldnt be done by normal means. I have encountered things in southern and mid ohio previously and all i could determine was this was a close encounter.",
