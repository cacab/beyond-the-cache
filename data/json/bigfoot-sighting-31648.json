  "observed": "At the time my unit was training in Ft. Pickett, VA.  We were conducting training for over a several day period.  The teams in the field kept asking if any other unit was training in the area because they could hear people walking nearby, but did not investigate so as not to give away their position, no other units were near.  One afternoon we distinctly heard several very loud knocks on a tree.  When asked, the field teams reported that they thought we were walking around and doing it.  We visually located each team and none were in the direction of the knocking.  Later that evening we heard a radio report of a \"bigfoot\" sighted on a range.",
