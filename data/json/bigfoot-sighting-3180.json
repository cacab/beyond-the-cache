  "observed": "This may not even be relevant now because it happened so many years ago, but when I was about 10 years old my sister and I were out in our yard playing a yard dart game ( the kind where you throw the plastic flower onto a stake in the yard) the only reason I mention what kind of game it was is to let you know how vivid this still remains in my mind. But anyway, we were playing in the yard it was close to getting dark but still daylight enough so that you could still see.  I don't quite remember if I heard a noise or what made me look across our road but when I looked, across the road on the edge of the woods I saw an image, similar to drawings I've seen of actual encounters.   It was walking at the edge of the woods kind of stooped over, using its hands to push the trees back out of its way.   All I could do was just stand there and look at it not really knowing what I was seeing.   I really don't know how long I stood there but I remember yelling at my sister who was then 7 years old, and telling her to run into the house.   She then looked and saw the same thing. As soon as I yelled at my sister it stopped dead in its tracks and just stood there and looked at us.   My sister and I still remember the feeling of not being able to move, and to this day we still get cold chills and our eyes water every time we talk about this. So anyway we eventually ran inside the house.  When we got in the house I remember my mom asking what was wrong because she said that both of us were as white as sheet.  We then went on to tell her what we had seen and were terrified to have her go outside  and check things out. Neither one of my parents ever saw anything but still to this day say they believe we did see something, whether it was someone playing a joke or possibly a bear but I still think to this day that it was Bigfoot or something similar.",
