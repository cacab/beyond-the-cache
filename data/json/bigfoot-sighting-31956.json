  "observed": "It was dusk and I was walking one of my sister's dogs. It had been raining but wasn't at the time we were walking. We rounded a corner & saw a figure on the road in front of us crossing the road - maybe about 200 feet away. It was about 5 feet tall (I'm 6 ft. tall & it was a good bit shorter than me). It was on 2 feet, had dark hair all over its body. The arms seemed very long. I could not see the face clearly - it did turn towards us.  The arms moved as it walked. I saw it step on the road then across a small ditch & low bank in one stride. It went off into the woods. The dog stood very still & rigid as we watched this figure. He never barked (which was amazing because he barks at everything!). Once the figure disappeared, he wanted to go after it, but of course I turned him around & we walked back to my sister's house.",
