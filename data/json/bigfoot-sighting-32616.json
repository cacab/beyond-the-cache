  "observed": "I have been walking my dog through Harris Forest Preserve for about 5 weeks now. About the last 3 days we have been walking back there I noticed a foul smell and starge howling noises. I didn't think much of it at the because I've heard alot of coyotes howling in the area. I should also add my dog seemed pretty stressed out and affraid the last couple walks we were on. The last walk we went on was kind of late, from 6 till about 7 pm after dark. We heard quite a few knocks on trees that seemed pretty close by and rocks were being thrown at me and my dog. At first I thought it was some kids screwing around, until I got through the trail to the pond in back. I was paralysed with fear after what happened next. I believe it was a Bigfoot that ran out about 10 feet in front of me and stopped for about 15 seconds, it let out a very loud scream right at me then turned around and ran straight through the pond. I also noticed that behind me appeared to be another very large figure that ran the opposite direction. The first one I got a very clear view of, I was 8 to 9 feet tall with very wide shoulders about twice as wide as mine, it had dark brown hair mixed with some grey, and it smelled awful. I did not get a very good look at the other one but it did appear to be 8 to 10 feet tall. I have never really been a believer and as a matter of fact I am the kind of person more likely to make fun of a believer. That being said I am having a hard time coming up with an explanation for this. This happen in early Janurary and it was about 35 degrees out and I don't think a person playing a joke would be able to handle the water temps.
