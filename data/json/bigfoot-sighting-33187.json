  "observed": "OK, let me start by saying I have always been fascinated by \"Big Foot.\"  I don't think it makes me biased because until recently I was always still skeptical but very curious. I recently had a sighting and was looking in the reports provided here to see if there had been many in KY.  I was shocked to see so many in KY and was completely floored when I saw a report not only in my same county but on the abandoned property behind my farm.  The report was from 1993 I think but our first sighting was in 2006. In 2006 my then 4yr old daughter told me that she saw Monkeys at the edge of my field as she was riding in my wifes car down our driveway.  She said There was a big one and a smaller one.  They both had red eyes and the bigger one looked like it was waving.  I asked her how big and she said the biggest one was a lot bigger than me (I'm 6'4\" 200lbs) and it was real hairy.  I dismissed it as a childs imagination but always kept it in mind because the description matched stories I had heard as a teenager about a big foot type creature in Lawrenceburg known as \"Howdy\" because he waves. Ive had her retell the story to friends and family over the years and it stays consistant but never much detail. I was actually jealous.  I thought, if she really did see something, why couldn't I have seen it too so I could know for sure, plus as I stated before, I was always curious.  I kept an extra eye out for a while but never saw anything and pretty much dismissed it. Modern Rifle season, November 2011.  I was deer hunting by myself on the same property (mine) that borders the abandoned ***** ******** mentioned in a previous report.  It was getting close to dusk and I was considering getting out of the deer stand soon when I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to look and  couldnt believe my eyes.  From left to right I watched 2 creatures, both larger than me and covered in long hair, running upright on 2 feet.  There was no mistake these were big foot(s).  One was very dark brown/almost black and the slightly smaller one was almost blonde.  More like coyote colored blonde.  They were both jogging with arms relaxed and looking behind them.  They ran within 25 yards right in front of me!  I honestly cant give much detail about the faces, they were looking behind them alot plus I was simply shocked and not looking for detail.  They covered ground quickly and were gone in less than 10 seconds.  They dissapeared into a clump of trees behind my pond.  I pulled my scope up but could only make out \"something' going through the woods once they passed.  I waited until almost dark and got down to look for fur or prints.  I couldnt find anything but it was cold, dark and I was shaking from the shock of seeing them and the cold combined.  I returned the next morning and found no sign.",
