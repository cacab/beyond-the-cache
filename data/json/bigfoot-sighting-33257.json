  "observed": "It was last winter 2010-2011 at about 1:00am. I was out on a wrecker call north of the Missouri River about a mile. I was loading a car on to my truck when I heard a deep grunt. I turned with my flash light and looked behind me and almost 100 feet behind me was an up right walking creature dragging the dead elk that the car I was towing had hit down the side of a hill. It was about 40 below zero I was cold and scared so i loaded up and got back to town.",
