  "observed": "On Sept. 9th I took my seven year old son trout fishing after school, around 4:00 in the evening. We had fished for probably an hour with no luck at this one big long hole with the front of the hole water moves swift and is 5 to 6 ft. deep. The back of the hole is shallow and slow moving about 15 or 20 ft across. So we decided to fish down to the next pot hole, and as we walked beside the creek I noticed across the creek there is sort of like sand bar where the water has eroded it off to a drop off not like a flat beach. In the sand bar I noticed the sand had been walked in and the sand had fallen of in the creek like an animal had forded the creek their.  On our side of the creek the bank is very very rocky with a lot of big rocks as big as cars and smaller line the creek and the surrounding area . About 15 ft below the sand bar on our side I was walking across some of these big rocks to fish this next hole.When I looked between the rocks and saw one BIG foot print in the wet creek bank sand. I dropped down in  between the rocks to look close at it .I am convinced that is was to wide to be a man or woman's . I put my boot beside it and I wear a size 10 an a half and this was probably a 15 0r 16 and and about 2 inches wider than my boot. It had undoubtedly crossed the river from the sand bar to this spot. The other side of the creek is rock cliffs an straight up no way to explore any direction.",
