  "observed": "I was cutting cedar shake blocks with a friend by a creek with a powersaw and we started to cut the first block off and I let the saw slow down because of the block almost being cut all the way threw the log. When I heard this thing from somewhere below us make some kind of scream like some man yelling for help but it was like long and drawn out and loud enough to hear this thing over the power saw running. So I looked up at my friend and said did you hear that he said yes I did. So then I shut the power saw off to listen and then maybe two min later this thing made a scream again.   I asked my friend what is that. We both thought how strange this loud sound was. Maybe five min later it screamed again. We heard this thing three times. We listened for another thirty min but never heard it again. My dad told me maybe a month before this time he had heard something screaming like a man or something that was in distress.  This was close to the same place to where we heard this thing.  There are no roads below where we heard this thing.",
