  "observed": "HAVING BEEN A FIRE-LOOKOUT ON MONUMENT #83 CANADIAN BORDER 1949, AND UPON COMPLETING MY TOUR ON THE LOOKOUT, I HIKED OUT DOWN THE TRAIL ABOUT THREE MILES TO WHERE IT BECAME FLAT And trail; was wide, all of a sudden began hearing loud posts crashing into apparently tree stumps and known to me there were no loggers or other campers in the area.  The tree knocks heard on the shows of BFRO, SOUND ABSOLUTELY nothing like what I heard. The knocks did not sound like an axe striking a wood or tree (sounding like a (chis-whop) the sounds I heard were definitly four to five foot lengths and dry enough to leave the impression of the loud sounds heard that SEEMED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 100-150 yards off to my right.  I HAVE TO SAY, AT THAT TIME, I NEVER HEARD ANY THING ABOUT A \"BIG FOOT\" UNTIL 1973, BUT STILL REMEMBERED THE STRANGE knocks heard back then.  Wish I HAD KNOWN, Maybe I would have watched for other signs,  now I am 89yrs old and still want to go back looking, believe I could with the help of pack strings.",
