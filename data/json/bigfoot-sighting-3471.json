  "observed": "My mother observed a large, beige creature at the edge of a woods area, about 1000 yards from our house. The house was surrounded on 3 sides by cornfields and a densely wooded area surrounded that. It was late fall, and the corn had been harvested, leaving bare fields. My mum was talking on the phone to her mum, and our dogs, (beagles) set up a terrible racket. She walked to the edge of the screen porch and saw an animal crouched down. Thinking it was maybe a bear (none in area) she asked her mum what it could be. The dogs barked and howled, but did not go any nearer than 500 feet to animal. The inside dogs were yelping and howling too. Suddenly, the creature straightened upright and looked toward the house. My mum said \"It's stood up and looking over here.\" Grandma told her not to go outside, but she opened the screen and called to the dogs. They were frantic; never afraid of anything, but this had them hysterical. The thing finally just walked into the woods. The whole encounter lasted about 15-20 seconds. As soon as it left the dogs settled right down and acted as if nothing was wrong. Earlier that summer, before harvest, my sisters and I found an area near the outside edge of the field, where the stalks had been trampled down and squashed, like something quite large had slept there.",
