  "observed": "My father and I are both proud Mountain State natives, although we no longer reside in WV. But we do enjoy returning every spring for trout fishing and sometimes smallmouth bass fishing. My father and I have been fishing the West Fork of the Greenbrier for trout for years and also enjoy camping there. We set camp up about a 1/4 mile from a little tiny place called Wildell. Its way out in the middle of no where. Our plans were to fish and camp April 26th, 27th, 28th. The first night was quiet and we just got some sleep. The next night around the fire we just decided to try fishing on the West Fork again instead of going to another stream. We were really tired so we ate a quick dinner and went to bed. My father snores really loud so I sleep in a separate tent. I was sleeping but kept hearing noises in the background, which is normal in the woods. But I kept hearing this screaming sound waaaay off on the side of the mountain across the road (which was in front of the camp). I didnt bother me much and I just kept trying to sleep but it kept getting closer, louder, and was just constantly screaming. It got so loud and close that at one point I litterly woke up, sat up quickly in my tent and said out loud \"what the #*%# is that!?\" At that moment the sounds stopped. I dont know if it heard me say that, hear me shuffling around in the tent but for whatever reason it stopped instantly. I told my dad about it the next morning and he said he didnt hear anything. People say that bobcats and mountain lions make sounds by \"screaming\" and it could have been. I really dont know as it was pitch black outside. All I can say is that it sounded like a woman screaming as hard as she could at the top of her lungs for as long as she could and it was it was such a solid level of noise I could feel it......if that even makes sense. I've never heard anything like that. That night after a long hard day of hard fishing with little luck, we ate dinner late because we fished a different stream an we didnt get back to camp until late. We cooked hamburgers in an iron skillet over the fire. The burgers were cooked in the left over bacon grease from breakfast and it smelled and tasted delicious. We were eating our burgers about 11:00 pm when my day said \"did you hear that?\" and I replied \"I didnt hear anything.\" As soon as I said that we both heard what sounded like someone yelling at the top of their lungs down by the river in a long \"hooooooOHHHHH\" yell. The river was about 500 yards away but you could hear it like they were just on the other side of the woods by our camp. It echoed a loooong ways thru the way.  I really dont know how to describe it. It was a really loud and level at first then the yell went up to an even higher pitch and it lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. At that point my dad turned to me and said \"What in the H@LL was that!?\" and I replied \"I dont know!\" We sat silently listening for another call but heard nothing. Then we thought it might have someone in trouble but we thought they would have been yelling for help or calling out someones name. Well. after a long restless night of little sleep nothing else happened. My dad and I talked about it the whole next morning. We have both never heard anything like that. It was a really loud, clear, powerful \"yell.\" So after we got home my dad was telling my mom about it and she laughed and said maybe it was bigfoot. My dad and I looked at each other with surprise on our faces. So to spare you the details, I got on the internet and did some research and found this site. Not only did I find this site, but I found another report from hunters at Wildell who said they saw tracks and one hunter saw 2 \"creatures.\" At this point my dad and I were a little freaked out. Then I came across the recording section on this website and listened to the recording from Snohomish County, WA and not only did my dad freak out but the hair on both my arms stood straight up and I was covered in goose bumps. That recording is EXACTLY what we heard. I have been a sportsman my whole life, even growing up fishing the mountains in WV, and I never miss a hunting season. I have heard and seen alot of things and I have NEVER heard anything like that in my life, nor has my dad. I havent told many people about this but the ones I have told it too have laughed and thought we were crazy. I dont care what they say or think, I know what I heard 2 nights in row and it really happened and I cant take it back.",
