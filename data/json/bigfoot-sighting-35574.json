  "observed": "I was out in the woods with two of my sons (16 & 18) and as we were leaving I saw some movement didn't think much of it. As we got up the trail by where I saw movement one of my sons noticed some foot prints, that were larger than normal and right next to some deer tracks. Then my other son described exactly what I saw even though I never described what I saw. Earlier in the day we saw a strange \"footprint\" in the mud also.",
