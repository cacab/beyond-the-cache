  "observed": "I think I might have seen a big foot on May 30, 2012.  I went outside to put my trash can at the street at about midnight. The only light was the porch lights on the house behind us.  When I walked around the corner of the house, I froze because I saw what looked like something standing at my neighbor's fence. They have a fence that is fenced in on three sides, just not at the front of the house, and what I saw was standing at the back of the fence, I think on my side of the fence, but not sure. All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing, but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence. All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence. It had long hair and it was not really moving.  Only the hair would move. At first I thought it was a person who had stopped and stood still when it saw me.  Then I realized it was way too big to be a person.  I admittedly have bad eyesight though, even with glasses on at night. On top of that I am a logical person with a master's degree, so I don't rush to conclusions, especially fanciful ones.  So I told myself it was just the shadows and light playing tricks on me.  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was. But I still felt uneasy and ran inside as fast as I could.  The next day (today) I went outside and looked for whatever it was that might have looked like a head and shoulders. But there as nothing there.  No plants, no trees, nothing propped up against the fence, no spanish moss, just a fence.  We went back outside tonight to look again and see if there was anything casting a funky shadow.  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows, there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders. I would estimate, given that the fence is about 6 feet tall, that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall.  It was broad shouldered. And it had long hair or fur on it's head.  I am not saying it was a bigfoot, because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain, but I don't think it was a person. If it was a person it was a very large, very tall, very hairy person.  Also, when I came back inside, my dog (a lab/border collie mix who is about 90 lbs) started growling.  He kept growling until I let him out of his kennel and he immediately ran to my back door.  I let him outside and he shot off.  Our yard is fenced in so he cannot leave the yard.  But ten minutes later when I went to let him back in, he wasn't near the back door. It took several minutes for him to come back to the door after I called repeatedly.  That is not like him.  He usually is begging to come back inside and doesn't hesitate when I call him.  After that he was very restless all night.",
