  "observed": "August 12-2012 2:30am I first heard a howl at 2:30 am less than 50 yards behind the house in the tree line. I walked out on too the porch with the spotlight and searched the tree line but could not see anything. Less than 5 minutes later I heard the howl again then immediately another howl less than 40 yards from me. I still could not see anything. Then the next howl was behind the garage and howled twice. I then eased back into the house and quietly closed the screen door. Suddenly there were small rocks hitting the porch roof, this lasted about 7-8 minutes. I went to the bedroom to wake my wife up to tell her what was happening. She of course didn't believe what I was telling her. Within 5-10 minutes she heard 2 howls to the left of the house about 75 yards from the house. No more then 10 minutes later we both heard 2 more howls across the road around 100 yards. Around 30 minutes later I heard one more howl back to the right of the house about 150 yards out. Quiet rest of the morning. I know what coyotes sound like, this was no coyote. This made the hair stand up on the back of your neck.",
