  "observed": "In Montcalm county Michigan a group of friends, my dog and I were walking down a dirt road that is adjacent from my grandparents cottage near (removed). The time was roughly eleven thirty when we set out for a late night walk, our plans were to walk down to the paved road that intersects the dirt road and back to the cottage. We were on our way back to the cottage and should I say this dirt road we were on runs right through a very dense woodland area that is almost dark in the day time due to the canopy of the trees above road, so at night our line of vision ended as soon as the trees began on the side of the road. Over my friends chatter and occasional laughter  I heard something that sounded rather large following us from behind us to the left, which was the side I was walking on. Whatever that was following us would only move at strategic times when my friends would get a bit too loud or started scraping their feet on the road.  I had the group stop and turn around to face the direction of the noise. One friend got close to me and whispered (removed) look over by that mailbox, and as I turned my head to the left the see what he was talking about I seen a large somewhat illuminated figure slowly walking in a small circle, almost dancing in a way, this really interested me. As soon as the groups attention was focused on the moving figure, I heard a low in volume not threatening grunt. We turned around to see a large pair or red almost orange eyes looking down at us from just within the woods. We stood there and watched it watch us for a few short moments then one friend took off running back to the cabin. As he took off the eyes, still looking directly at me seemed to retreat back into the woods a few yards then got low to the ground continuing to go further and further into the woods. I watched the eyes then disappear, so we walked back to the cottage. I did not feel threatened one bit by this incident although my one friend ran for the cottage.",
