  "observed": "A friend and I were driving east on Hwy 27 between Chiefland and Bronson. Hwy 27 is a four lane road. The lanes are separated by a wide grass median, maybe 50 feet wide that serves as a drainage feature for the highway. It was September 29, 2012. The time was about 8 pm and it was dark and raining a little. The sighting occurred about a quarter mile east of the junction of 339 and 27. My truck has loose steering and it drifted a little almost going into the grass median. A large creature jumped up from a squatlike stance like it was startled and raised its arms over its head. It ran on two legs to the north across the highway. The creature was brownish/reddish color and very muscular. It was between 7 and 8 feet tall. We could only see the back of the creature because it ran away from us and we were past it in an instant. We turned around but it was already gone. We heard no noise or sound from the creature.",
