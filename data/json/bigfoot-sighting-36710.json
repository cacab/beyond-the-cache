  "observed": "We were out driving looking for a bigfoot sighting, and after driving for over an hour we had one. It was in east Orlando, fl near Ft. Christmas Florida on Fort Christmas Road and went down a smaller road and were driving looking and it ran out from behind a tree something very large. One of the guys saw its eyes and said they were huge. It ran very fast, we stopped and rolled down window, there was a smell and then we turned around and looked more for it. Off to the right on the road is a wild life preserve. With a lot of power lines and a river called the Econlochahatche River.",
