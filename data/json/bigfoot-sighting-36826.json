  "observed": "My bigfoot sighting accurred on Saturday, October 27th, 2012 about 6:00pm. We were on Highway 50 heading towards Christmas, Florida when we crossed over the St. John's river. I was sitting in the back of the car, we were talking and I just happened to glance over to the right to look at the river when I saw a brown upright figure just walking away from the water's edge. Even though it was a distance away, I could see that it was one color from head to toe and the whole body was evenly shapped like an animal in the distance rather than a person wearing clothing. As I saw it take those couple of steps I could see the arms swing with the motion of the legs. When we arrive at the restaurant I said to my boyfriend that I think I just saw a sasquatch, that it just didn't look like a person. I've been thinking about it ever since.",
