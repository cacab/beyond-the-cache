  "observed": "We were coming home from our grandson's baseball game on State Route 39 west of Nashville, Ohio.  After passing State Route 179 and driving a short distance, something came out of a wooded area into a bean field and started to cross the road. The three of us saw it on the south side of the road just as it finished crossing the road. It turned and looked at us as we were passing and we could see it proceed up the bank into a wooded area.  There was another car in front of us that slowed down obviously since they saw the same thing.",
