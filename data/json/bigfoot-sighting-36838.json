  "observed": "I live outside Farmington MO and I have a deer lick just out side the wood line in my back yard and there is always deer. I was just getting home from work one night after I closed, it was about 11 and I like to see the deer just to see what we have around my house. And in the upper left hand corner of my yard about 25 yards away from my deer lick I saw a big figure about 7' maybe 8' tall. I was thinking it was a poacher in the yard killing deer. So I turned my brights on and started walking toward the figure. As I was walking I started to smell kinda like a smell of body odor and mildew smell and I was scared when I realized it wasn't a hunter. It took off down a game trail in the brush. I also need to say I'm not hunting off the lick, and the deer run when I pull up. I wasn't walking over there with a group of deer. But to continue, the next day I walked back into the woods and looked. There is a bunch of nesting spots for deer and a spot where it looks like a rock bed that smelled awful, like death.",
