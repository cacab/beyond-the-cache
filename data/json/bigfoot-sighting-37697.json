  "observed": "It was the November deer season in Illinois 1993 I think. I was hunting some ground north of Hettick, Illinois . About sunrise I heard twigs snapping behind  me to my right , I was in a tree-stand overlooking a field, anticipating a deer but no deer came out but something yelled/screamed very loud that sent chills through me . What seemed like minutes probably only 30 seconds what came out of the timber that was walking upright and dark brown all over and somewhere between 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall at the edge of one timber crossing to another , probably a distance of about 20 yards between the two timbers , this thing whatever it was did not seem concerned that I was there. I have been raised in Illinois all my life hunting and out in the woods a lot and I have never seen or heard anything like this nor do I care to ever again .",
