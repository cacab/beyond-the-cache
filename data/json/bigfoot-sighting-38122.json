  "observed": "I was home alone at the time watching t.v in the living room when i got a phone call from a family member that lives on the hill behind me saying my cousin's girlfriend had heard the screams. which I had heard before a few times actually. I muted the t.v and went out on the porch to see if i could hear it. i noticed that the dogs that normally barking were unusually quiet. My cousin said why don't you do a call to see if you can get a response. So I did a howl and got no response i stood on my porch for about 10 minutes and figured if there was a bigfoot in the area it probably moved on by then. I was just about to go back in the house when I noticed something moving behind a large pine tree that stands in our yard. I stood there for a moment because I thought the chickens might be roosting in the tree when I seen the sasquatch peek around the tree. I saw it and it saw me, our eyes met and he stepped out from behind the tree I ran inside but watched through the open door it kept watching me, then in 3 large steps was across the road and faded into the darkness. It had long brown hair. I measured where it stood after. and where its head was, using the pine tree for scale, I measured ten feet 2 inch tall there was one foot print in the yard I didn't have any casting supplies so I took a picture of it and measured the foot print at 17 inches. I know what I saw I feel very privileged to have seen it.",
