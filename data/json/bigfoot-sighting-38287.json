  "observed": "On Tuesday (Dec. 4th, 2012) I woke up to my dogs alarm barking out in their outside kennel.  I grabbed a large flashlight on my way to the back door.  I was most worried about it being a skunk that was causing the dogs to bark, as I have noticed once in a great while, that I have caught the scent of a skunk early in the morning or in the middle of the night when I have stepped outside to quiet the dogs and I didn’t want to surprise one myself. So, I cautiously and quietly opened the back door, scanned around the kennel for any smelly, black and white creatures lurking about when I noticed some movement out of the corner of my eye. Something moved behind the fruit trees down by the junction of where our driveway and the road meet (about 50 ft. from the back door).  The moon was half full, but the night was clear and the moon was giving off a lot of light. I stepped out to better see what the movement was from; expecting a dog, deer or person to come into view, but what I saw was quite different.  Before I describe what I saw, let me just say that I have long taken the stand that there is no such thing as a Sasquatch and that if there were such a creature, we would have at least found some skeletal remains as proof. I am going to only give a description of what I saw, but not an explanation, because I do not have one. I stood in shock after this occurred, my mind reeling, trying to find a reasonable, logical explanation, but I could not find one. I want to also point out that I was fully awake, having been up and awake the 15 minutes before this occurred.  I have lived for decades in very rural areas next to large sections of DNR forest lands, I have seen my share of deer, bear, cougars, etc. in daytime and at night and that or a person is what I was expecting to see. So, I saw some movement and stepped out to better see what it was that was causing the commotion and disturbing the dogs, both of whom were now quiet and hiding in their dog houses. The movement to my right stilled for just a moment (it stood behind a plum tree), partially hidden from my view.  I turned on my  flashlight and it then  took off at breakneck speed up the road, running uphill.  It covering ground way too fast and did so on two legs! It was very tall, but I could only see its profile, so I have no idea of how broad it was. What I could clearly see is that it ran upright, with long strides, swinging its arms and it looked to me like it was covered in shreds. It had a slightly pointed head, no neck and appeared light colored, almost silvery gray, but that could be from the moonlight, which was giving everything a kind of slivery sheen that night.  It quickly glanced over its shoulder, but I couldn’t see any features other than noting that its head turned slightly, but it did not seem to slow down. Just where the road turns left, bearing around the corner, it made one great leap, planting one food on the pavement and clearing the grass/graveled side of the road, plus several feet of tall grass and smoothly plummeted out of sight down the steep embankment. The next morning when I went to look for any clues were I saw it leave the road we found that the grass (just where it meets the pavement) was matted down and there was a large game trail type hole in the bramble, just over the embankment. Nothing else, no clear tracks, no strips of cloth or fur, no other clues…I am stumped. I had made up my mind to not even tell anyone, because it sounds so unbelievable and because even talking about it is kind of disturbing. I suspect I will never know for sure what it was, but I will surely take others stories with more serious consideration than I ever have before.",
