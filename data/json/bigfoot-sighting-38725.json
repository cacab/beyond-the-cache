  "observed": "I am a tree trimmer in Ohio and today 1-2-13, me and the crew I was with seen tracks in the snow. For sure not human, this thing had an almost 6ft stride and you could see the toes and the whole outline of the feet. The bottom line is I know just what I saw I'm 29 years old and i have hunted my whole life so when it comes to tracks I know what I'm looking at. There is no doubt in my mind there is a big foot there in northern Ohio.",
