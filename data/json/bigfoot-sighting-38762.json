  "observed": "In 1978-1979 I saw the lower half of a bigfoot when driving home from work. It was just getting dark and was on Skyline Drive in Ringwood, NJ.   I came around a bend in the road and caught a glimpse of the hips and two hairy legs walking across the road. Definitely not a human. Took one step from the center of my lane and with one step, not a run, was over the sideline and into the woods. I was about 19 at the time. No one believes me to this day. I was told by my mom about a year later that the cars that were always parked on the top of the mountain was a bigfoot research team. Makes sense. Have you ever considered checking Ringwood out?",
