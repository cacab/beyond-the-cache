  "observed": "I live in The Villages, Florida which is a community encompassing three counties (Sumter, Lake, and Marion).  Behind my house there is one of those high tower power line paths.  On the other side, there are more homes.  The area is urban, but close to wooded areas.  One night in early to mid-December my partner and I were sitting on our lanai (as we do nightly).  It was about 10:00 p.m. or so.  Suddenly the quiet was broken by a loud cry which sounded like it was coming from close to the street.  We looked at each other and asked each other jokingly, “Is that Bigfoot?”  It did not sound like any human we had ever heard. We listened and no more sounds.  The next night, I was sitting on the lanai, my partner had not yet come out, about 9:00 p.m.  I stopped the sound on my computer and just then I heard, distinctly, two rocks clack together at the end of my short backyard, close to where my neighbor to the left and I share a property line close.  There are tall, 6-7 foot, plants at the end of my property. I sat there for maybe 15 minutes listening and heard nothing more.  A few days later, for two days, my partner and I came out and smelled a strange, unknown, odor.  My dog didn’t make any noise but sniffed the air.   It wasn’t a bad odor, just unusual.  A few days later, I was again sitting on the lanai, about 11:00 p.m. and to my left I heard a stone hit the side of my home which made it vibrate.  I sat quietly for a few minutes and went back to my business.  An hour later, when I got ready to go inside, I heard what sounded like 4-5 pebbles hitting the side of the lanai where I was standing.  About 3 nights ago, my partner and I were sitting on the lanai again, this time it was lightly raining.  It was about 11:30 p.m.  Suddenly we heard a barrage of pebbles hit the side of the lanai.   My partner said, those were stones.  I was unsure if it could have been the rain.  A few moments later, another barrage of pebbles hit our lanai.  My dog got up and looked.  It was not the gentle rain we were hearing.  After the second time, we didn’t hear anything else.  I don’t know if this is even possible to be bothered by a Bigfoot in The Villages.  We are the only ones who sit on our lanai after dark in this area.  What do you think?  I do not want this information posted to your website until I hear from the BFRO to see if there is a possibility that our suspicions can possibly be true.  Believe me, this is truly bewildering.",
