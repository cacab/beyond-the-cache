  "observed": "In 1998 or 1999 my brother and a friend were meeting up with me and another friend at home. When they came in the house they were both filled with fear with what that had just saw. It was winter time and it was also in the evening around 7 p.m. and raining. They were driving down route 24 near the Angola light when something ran across the road on all fours. Then when it got across the road to the field they both said it stood up and it had red eyes. I just started to watch the television show finding bigfoot and remembered that night and called my brother up again to get the details to see if I remembered it right.",
