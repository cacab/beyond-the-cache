  "observed": "I WAS GOING UP TO HARDY AR.TO LOOK AT SOME LAND I HAVE ON WHITE HORSE MT. THE ROAD UP THERE IS GRAVEL. AS I WAS COMING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BLACK BEAR IN THE ROAD. I HONKED MY HORN, THEN A FEMALE BIGFOOT CAME OUT FROM BEHIND SOME TREES PICKED UP WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BEAR BUT WAS A YOUNG BIGFOOT. YOU COULD TELL IT WAS A FEMALE BECAUSE IT HAD BREASTS. SHE WAS A DARK BROWN ABOUT 7 FT TALL THE BABY WAS DARK BLACK. SHE WALKED OUT FROM THE TREES PICKED UP THE BABY AND WENT BACK IN TO THE TREES. I MUST SAY I WAS SCARED. I OPENED MY DOOR TO SEE WHERE SHE WAS GOING WHEN A SMALL ROCK HIT MY CAR FROM BEHIND ME. I TURN TO SEE ANTHER BIGFOOT ABOUT 6 FT FROM MY CAR. THIS ONE WAS BIGGER ABOUT 9 FT TALL . THE BIGFOOT YELLED AT ME WITH A SOUND LIKE I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE, I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS. THIS WAS LIKE NOTHING I HAVE HEARD OR SEEN IN MY LIFE.  I GOT BACK IN MY CAR. IT WAS STILL BEHIND MY CAR THEN IT WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD AND  INTO THE WOODS. I DROVE UP THE ROAD ABOUT 150 YARDS, STOPPED AND GOT OUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I JUST SAW I WAS SCARED AND CONFUSED STILL LOOKING TO SEE IF I MIGHT SEE AND HEAR WHERE THEY WENT. WHEN I GOT MORE ROCKS HITTING MY CAR AND AROUND ME FROM WHERE THE BIG BIGFOOT WENT IN TO THE WOODS. I COULD HEAR HIM. I DON'T THINK HE WANTED TO HURT ME BUT HE WANTED ME OUT OF THERE. THIS HAPPENED EARLY MORNING IN 2008, JANUARY I BELIEVE I SEEN A FAMILY OF BIGFOOTS",
