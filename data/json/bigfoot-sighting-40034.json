  "observed": "In May of 1985 on a sunny afternoon, a realtor in Ormond Beach took me north on Beach Street.  We turned left and entered The Village of Pine Run.  Before reaching the area of houses, I spotted what looked like a young pre-teen holding a tall stick vertically.  Suddenly, the other than human walked on hands and feet to the middle of the road and then stood erect.  My realtor slammed on the breaks and cried, \"What is that?\"  I suggested a bear but the shape of the head was not that of a bear.  We agreed it was not a monkey due to no long tail and.  It appeared to be 4.5 to 5ft. tall.  It disappeared into the woods.",
