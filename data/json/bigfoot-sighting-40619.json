  "observed": "It was a nice day out, so i decided to walk my dog. I took him on the bike path for a small walk. We went past a turn and then my dog started to bark. I looked in that direction and noticed a big, bulky, hairy creature. I stood and watched for about 5 seconds and it just walked across to the other side into the brush. I couldn't tape it because I didn't have my I-pod with me. So we ran home, I got my I-pod and went back, this time with my other dog. I walked down to where the creature was and noticed a footprint. I took one picture of it on my I-pod.",
