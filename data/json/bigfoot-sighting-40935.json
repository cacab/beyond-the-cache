  "observed": "On Saturday April 13 at 1:30 am a friend and I were driving south on Hwy 19 in Levy county FL we saw something at the woods line which almost instantly was in the road by center line. I thought we were gonna hit it. It appeared to be brown, about 8-9 ft tall and no face. Its arms appeared to b reached out as if to hit the car . In shock as to what we had just seen my friend hit the brakes. I then told him to keep going as I did not want to turn back not knowing what had just happened. Could bring harm to us or worse . We were about 4-5 miles north of otter creek . In between Chiefland and Otter Creek . This figure or creature appeared to be human shaped. I've always been a skeptic of bigfoot but now I'm definately a believer. I know what I saw and so did my friend . There is no houses or street lights  or driveways for miles in this area so I don't think this was a prank . Also it was incredible how fast this creature was able to get from woods line to center of road. It had to be at least 30 yds. I will never forget what we experienced that morning .",
