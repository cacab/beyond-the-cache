  "observed": "It was 3 a.m., I having hard time sleeping went out onto 2nd floor deck which is about 10+ feet high. The house is on the Ocean side so critters and brush moving is normal but this night was different, it was very dark and too quiet, not even a frog croaking.  I heard an extra amount of brush rustling then normal, then a high pitched animal screamed out, which I now identify as a rabbit in great distress (I put out food for the wild rabbits). A short span of silence then something stumbled or fell and let out a deep moan.  I rain into the house to grab a flashlight and went back out on the deck. As I was trying to find the switch for the dang ancient lantern type flashlight I heard more brush moving, then 4 loud thuds on this fake wooden dock that's on the northern edge on the lot. The dock goes into the brush where fresh water collects during rain season and just ends, is about 20 feet long and begins at the edge of the yard which is also the NW corner of the deck support. Four thudding stomps then off the dock onto the lawn, two more stomps and the creature stopped directly below me standing above on the deck.  I froze, it froze and then it started smelling me! Deep long inhales, short outs, I could not see much thru the deck boards just something dark and big and frankly it was so frightening that this creature was just a foot or so underneath me below my feet. I said screw the lantern and ran for the house.",
