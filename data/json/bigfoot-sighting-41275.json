  "observed": "Hey guys and Lady, My name is xxx and I have never seen a Bigfoot or Sasquatch. I do however believe that something could be out there. May 23rd (2013) at around 11:30 pm I was on my way to the Orlando Airport to pick up my son-in-law. I was on the Beach Line or 528 toll road. I had slowed down due to his flight being delayed and it had been raining when I saw something moving from the side of the road toward the fence and pasture land.  It is not unusual to see deer, wild turkeys and from time to time hogs even on this busy road, however this was none of the above. What I saw was very large, hunched over, and moving quickly toward  the wire fence and was a greyish color and the hair was longer, so it was not a loose cow or large hog. I was close enough to see the size and it was big, I cannot tell you how tall it was only a guess. I have heard about The Skunk Ape but again never seen anything and I don't go out looking for one, I just know what I saw.  There is a lot of wet land and swamp land close to the Orlando International Airport and The Beach Line is a major toll road that connects the east cost of our area to I-4 in Orlando. Thank you, XXX",
