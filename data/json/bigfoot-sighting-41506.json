  "observed": "Was driving home tonight from a fishing trip.  I saw something reddish brown looking over a guard rail.  Could only see the head and part of the shoulders, for the rail was at the top of a hill.  It wasn't a bear, or have never heard of a brown bear in the area.  We do have some black bear here and there.  The encounter/sighting was only for a few seconds as I drove by with high beams on.",
