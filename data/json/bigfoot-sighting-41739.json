  "observed": "I was traveling up [road name omitted] about 7am or a little after. I was topping the hill when movement caught my eyes, about 800 to 900 ft. ahead. It was large and dark colored. When I got to the spot it crossed the road, I slowed down some to see if I could see if it was still there. I was still driving so I couldn't just take my eyes completely off the road, (I should have stopped) but as much a I could, I looked up the small hill, there was a massive creature on top of the hill with gray coarse hair about 3 to 4 in. long. Its chest was massive and it had a white spot in its chest about two foot across. I was so in amazement it never even occurred to me to look up. Its chest was about 3 ft. across and on each side of the white there was about 6 to 7 in. of more coarse gray hair, the color of a gray fox or coyote. I went back after work, but did not find tracks or disturbance of any kind. There was an overpowering smell. It smelled like fresh meat, like a meat locker.",
