  "observed": "This sighting occurred while doing a Paranormal Investigation at Octagon Hall in Franklin, Kentucky. Upon arrival, we talked to the curator of the property and he advised us that an investigator from the previous night had a possible Bigfoot sighting. He also produced a cell phone picture taken the next day of the fields about 3/4 of a mile away where the sighting took place. Around 2 a.m. a teammate and myself headed out to investigate the area in question. There is a large clump of hardwood trees and other foliage (about 3/4 mile long & 1/2 mile wide) in the middle of the otherwise barren field I vocalized a loud \"whoop\" a few times with no results. As time passed I decided to try the loudest, most guttural howl I could muster. I performed the call and heard two responses from a mile or so in the distance, but thought it could be the echo from the howl. A few minutes later my fellow investigator and I saw movement beside one of the trees about 30 - 40 yards away. We both stood still and saw a large silhouette of a humanoid figure peek out from behind a tree. It swayed left 3 times, paused; then sway 2-3 times to the right and stop.Since we weren't using our flashlights, our eyes were very attuned to the darkness.The figure was around 7 feet plus in height, the 1/2 of a large head, shoulder and arms that were past the knees.This activity continued foe a few minutes, to the point that I asked my fellow investigator if he was seeing what I was seeing. We actually took turns mimicking the movement as it happened. First me, then him. The timing and movement was exactly the same in real time as what we were viewing. We initially thought it could be a \"shadow figure\" of a large Civil War soldier, but the height, arm length and recent activity on the property prompted me to conclude that it was a flesh and blood Bigfoot sighting and not of a spiritual nature. When we tried to get closer to the figure it retreated for a final time     and was no longer there. We both went to the tree and there was nothing there that could explain the dark figure we both saw.",
