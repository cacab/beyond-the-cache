  "title": "Possible nighttime sighting while camping on a farm on a foggy night near Nashville",

  "observed": "I saw a shadow of a beast, about 50 feet away from the edge of the field.... It was around 9:47pm and a few people went away from our camp fire to an open field to see the milky way. A dense fog had appeared over the higher field flowers and tall grass behind our camp site. As we were gazing up, I took time quietly to assess the landscape just under and to the left of my view of the big dipper, and over the fog in the open field. My eyes had adjusted to the night and a shadowy figure of a huge being started to appear. It was dark against the fog. It was in the middle of the field and looked to be standing, leaning forward on its left leg. There were no trees casting a shadow, there were no lights to cast a shadow. It gives me goosebumps to explain it. I was alarmed but was afraid that my friends were playing a joke on me, because it was my first time at the farm, to camp with them. I have been camping before and nothing has ever scared me other than spiders. I tried to point out what I was seeing. I didn't yell, but firmly asked people to look at that and ask what is that?. But they couldn't see what I was pointing at. It seemed that nobody was paying attention to me. At that time I decided to leave the group and head back to the fire out of my own fear and wanting to feel safe. They followed me, I felt a little bad I left my friends but they didn't seem alarmed and were actually wanting an encounter. We sat by the fire and heard coyotes howling, for about 5 minutes then they abruptly stopped. I was afraid to go to bed until my tent buddy went with me. I kept my feelings to myself because I didn't want to the butt of a joke, but I know what I saw.",
