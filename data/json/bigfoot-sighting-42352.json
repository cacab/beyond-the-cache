  "observed": "Late Oct 2004. I was picking Matsutaki mushrooms near Storm Ranch in Coos County. I noticed free range cattle acting spooked so I kept my path moving in a clock wise motion. Periodically the cattle would sound off, but always behind me, roughly at my 7 o'clock. This happened for around 3 hours and when I decided to call it a night and hiked out to the road. When I got there I heard the cattle again. This time a huge bi- pedal animal ran up the side of the road directly at me. It was 7+ feet tall, huge shoulders, covered in reddish blonde, brown hair, no neck, pointed head, long arms and shorter legs. I could hear the bare feet slapping the road surface as it ran. I was frozen with fear. This thing came within 100 feet of me and stopped. I could see its breath as it stood there breathing heavily. After a few seconds, it turned away from me and with 2 bounds it cleared a two lane road, then jumped over a patch of sala brush. The brush stood 4' tall and extended off the road 20 feet. I never heard it land and the rest of the walk out I heard what sounded like Racoons chattering all around me.",
