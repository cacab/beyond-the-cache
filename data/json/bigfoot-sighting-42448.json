  "observed": "Sept 30, 2013. Route 109 halfway between Hoquiam/Aberdeen and Ocean Shores Washington. I was driving back from Hoquiam to Ocean Shores where I live when a deer ran across the road heading south about an eighth of a mile ahead of me.  From experience I know that if one deer crosses the road there is a good chance that another is right behind it and so I slowed way down.  Instead of a deer, here comes this guy that makes it across the road in three strides at a dead run.  I came to a complete stop, somewhat in shock...like \"what the HELL am I looking at?\" This guy (yup it was a male, no question about that..)stops at the top of the roadside berm, turns around and looks right at me.  He gave me a grin that was CLEARLY a threat, turned back around and vanished into the roadside brush. So I got to see a Sasquatch up close and personal.  My window was down and I was no more than 20 feet from him.  His face was human looking except that he had no chin and he had a somewhat heavy brow ridge.  The nose was a human nose and was more european than african looking.  The eyes were black, the skin was grey as was his hair and he had more or less human teeth...what was left of them.  His teeth were in terrible condition.  When he ran, his palms were down, not thumbs up like us, and when he stood his palms faced back rather than thumbs forward like a person.  The arms looked a bit longer than a human but not more than half a hand length longer.  Also since it was around one in the afternoon and I was looking south at him I could see the shape of his head through the hair in the sun.  The hair sticks way up and makes him look like he has a pointy head but really the shape of the head is human.  My guess and it is only a guess,  is that he was about 7-8 feet tall.  I didn't have time to take a picture.  It all happened so quickly.",
