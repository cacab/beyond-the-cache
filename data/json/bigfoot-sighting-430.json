  "observed": "My brother and I were standing in some dense under brush at the edge of a very marshy area while we were trailblazing and we heard a howl, but it was a very deep and very loud it echoed in the trees and kind of scared us at first but it seemed a little ways off so we sat and listened. Then the sound changed and was exactly the same sound as the recording that Matt Moneymaker made in Ohio Valley called Bigfoot Scream which is actually what prompted me to write this. We listened to it for about a half hour and could swear we heard an answer but it was faint.",
