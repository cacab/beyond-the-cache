Lived on family farm ... a bigfoot came to the back of my mobile home and stood outside my screen window.....stayed there for 1 - 2 minutes - cavernous breathing,  most terrifying , petrifying moment of my life  ....long story,   I'm at work now,   at the time called the University of Pennsylvania who referred me to Grover Krantz at the University of Washington State....He received a detailed report and was plotting sightings in the area.....",
