  "observed": "On Sunday, May 19, 2002, my family and I were camping on our land, riding a dirt bike and hiking. While we were taking turns riding our motorcycle, my eleven year old son spotted what looked like a \"cave man\" sitting near our camp site, about 75 yeards away. The view of it was slightly obstructed by some large straw bales, therefore I didn't see it at first when my son tried to point it out to me. By the time I finally saw it, it had stood up and was walking away towards heavy tree growth and a steep ravine. What I saw was a very large, man-like, reddish brown colored, hairy creature with its back towards me. All I could see was it's upper half, stooped forward slightly, with what appeared to be a very long, muscular right arm. The Head appeared larger than human from my angle. My son saw the right side of it's face, saying it looked like a cave-man like in the books. The face had light brown skin, with no hair on it's face, but slightly deformed-looking. That's about all he can recall. I think it took him totally by surprise. It appeared to be about seven feet tall. After calming down from this we decided to walk in the direction it headed for and found three or four very large foot prints in the creek bed area. They were slightly larger than my size thirteen boots, with five distinct human-type toes. Later that afternoon while I was riding the dirt bike, it suddenly stopped on me, about a half mile from the sighting. Looking at the wiring on the motorcycle, and alone there in the gully, I heard a very high pitched scream coming from what seemed a quarter to half mile away from me, opposite the direction of our camp. i thought it might be my family, but after getting the bike up and running right away, I quickly discovered it couldn't have been them. They were near our camp to the rear of me. No one else was on the land but us. That evening, our closest neighbor's ( 1 1/2 miles away) dog started barking like crazy around 11:00 pm and was heading our way down thru the woods. I could hear the dog barking all night long, while  what seemed he was following or chasing something all over the place. Around 3:30 am, I could hear the dog was about one hundred yards away from us, just going nuts and acting very vicious. All of a sudden, while laying there in our tent, I heard something huge come crashing thru the trees and run right by my head, with what sounded like bi-pedal type footsteps, only extremely fast and heavy (the ground near my head shook somewhat when it went by), with the dog right behind it. I sat up and counted the heads in my tent to be sure we were all accounted for. Then the dog let out a terrible yelp and everything got very quiet. Needless to say, I stayed up and slowly went outside to check on things and light a camp fire for warmth and security.",
