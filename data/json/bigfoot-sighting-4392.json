  "observed": "My wife, daughter and I were camping at Baker Lake . It was night, the generator and campfire were out. It is very dark, cant see your hand in front of your face.  We were sleeping, when I was awakened by heavy footsteps walking by the tent. The footsteps continued towards the picnic table and stopped.  I heard the clanking of silverware, very slight however.  Soon thereafter the footsteps walked out the other end of the campsite. Definetly was a bipedal creature. Very heavy footsteps, that were rapid.  It walked with a purpose.It was so dark and so heavily wooded that I'm still amazed at how quikly it moved.  I had an opportunity to unzip the tent and grab the flashlight when it paused at the picnic table, but the heavy footsteps,the pitch dark, 3year old daughter whom I was thinking about how to protect if necessary, made me pause with fear.  I'm absolutley convinced that I heard Bigfoot.  I searched in the AM for tracks, but the summer was dry. No soft ground, mud or anything.",
