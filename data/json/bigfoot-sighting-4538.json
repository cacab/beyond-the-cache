  "observed": "Big foot sighting Saturday June 15, 2002 At approximately 8:30 pm I was on my way back from a dinner with my grandfather Near Shiprock, NM.  While sitting on the passenger side of my mom's truck I was looking out the window. On state highway near crystal NM. before bowl canyon turn off.  At that moment I was feeling calm, bored and frustrated with trying to calm my younger cousin who was very hyper. So. while I was looking for something to amuse him I sighted something unusual moving, it was HUGE. It was as tall as the cedar trees that are around there. I was very scared and shaken when I saw it. I thought \"What the heck is that!\" It looked like a man but, as I was watching it I noticed it had hair covering its whole body with a mixture of grey/ dark brown and white on its chest. The head and the feet also the hands were all dark in color and the legs were dark grey. The face was lighter in color and when I saw the face it was turned toward my direction. The forhead was most unusual and it really stuck out with no neck. It had a little slump in the shoulder and its arm spanned down to its knees. It took large steps and its arms swung back and forth. The distance from the highway was about 60 yards. and I told my mom to stop, but she was scared, too scared to turn around.",
