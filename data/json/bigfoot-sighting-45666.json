  "title": "Two friends witness daytime road crossing near Conifer",

  "observed": "A friend and I had just started heading home from a day trip in the conifer area of Colorado. As we drove down a stretch of road with approx 1/2 miles visibility, we \"both\" saw a creature run from one side of the highway to the other. This creature was tall considering we had been about 4-500 hundred feet away in the car. It effortlessly took a few long strides and cleared the entire width of the road. It was clearly upright on two feet, which at that point both of us looked at each other wide eyed, like we couldn't really register what we've just saw. Once we pulled off to the spot that it had crossed, we both took notice that there was about 5-6 mule deer that seemed to be completely undisturbed or spooked. We both realized that if this was a human, these deer would not have been anywhere close to the commotion. This was my very first and only sighting and I'm absolutely positive what we saw was authentic. The mix of weather and the time of day reduced the hiker and tourist traffic that day, so the thought of someone playing games isn't a viable conclusion to me. My friend is also convinced, since he was raised in New Hampshire and has had similar experiences. Since that day, I've been hooked! My friend and I are extreme outdoorsmen with many years of survival training, so we will be spending a lot more time in the area of our sighting soon. Just FYI, the exact area of our sighting was between Wellington Lake and scraggy mountain ranch. Thanks for taking the time to read this as I'm sure you get a ton of submissions.",

  "location_details": "I gave a brief description of the location. It was a quiet day. There's a couple shooting ranges close by which your normally able to hear, but clearly nobody was around. I've always commented to people I take up there that the sighting area is a great place to see wildlife crossing the road. What my friend and I saw that day was the furthest thing from what I'd expected to see crossing.",
