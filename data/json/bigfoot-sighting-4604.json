  "observed": "It's been about 6 or 7 years and the area has grown where this happened.  I was camping at Lost Lake in Oregon and doing the usual hike around the area.  I came to a little creek crossing and small ravine about 200 yds behind the local store and found myself gazing at what appeared to be a fallen tree with a broken stump about 6ft up and some odd features in it.  Ex: Dark features that kind resembled eyes and arms coming across a leg.  Like if you were to sit over your feet in a crouched position.  It was about 3pm so the effects could have been from lighting and the trees.  Either way I thought it looked cool and wanted to go get my camera.  I placed a pile of rocks directly across from it and ran literaly and got my camera.  Upon arriving back at the location, about 15 min later, I noticed my pyramid of rocks was knocked over and when I looked across the way there was nothing.  No fallen tree, no branches and nothing worth taking a picture of.  I searched around the area thinking I was looking from the wrong angle but the only thing right across the way could have in no way been what I was looking at.  A few days later back in Portland, OR the news said that there had been a report of a Bigfoot in that area.  I have never gone camping there again!",
