  "observed": "This happened about 13 years ago, but I remember it like yesterday. I used to knock on my younger brother's window at night to scare him, it had been a long running joke between us. I climbed out the window in the bedroom I was staying in and brought my mom's small dog with me. When I got to my brother's window to knock I got about three inches away from knocking when I heard a load growl/roar. It was really dark so I couldn't really see very well. The figure that growled at me was way taller than me, had to be at least 6-8 feet tall. The growl was so load that it vibrated through my body. I was so scared that I couldn't move at first. When I was finally able to move I ran as fast as I could and dove back into the window I came out of. I was so scared that I ran to tell my brother about it and slept on his bedroom floor that night and never knocked on his window again!",
