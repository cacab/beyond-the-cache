  "observed": "A friend and myself were coming home from a party, about 10:30 at night. We were in his Chevy van. Something ran out in front of us. He slammed on his brakes and this large animal on 2 legs bent at the waist looked right at us, 3 to 4ft. away. I was close enough to see the pupil and its eyes were bloodshot. Small head not a bear. Long brown matted hair with a blond tint here and there. As it went by watching us, I felt it was scared. I continued to watch and it was bent at the waist and it hip was level with my vision in van. This all happened very quick, 4 to 5 steps and it cleared the road. Another car was comming at us and went into the ditch. We drove on about 2 min. and I said to my friend, Did you see something back there and he stoped the van and said I didn't want to say anything, I asked him tell me what you seen and I was not crazy either. We have both told the story here and there but have never told you or police, No one would believe us. You do not have to believe us either but it is the truth.",
