  "observed": "This event took place a couple years ago.  I have a biology degree and work as a wildlife biologist.  I usually don't tell people about it, but after reading some other stories on your web page -why not. I was with a group of friends hiking up to a mountain lake called Lilly Lake on Mt. Blanca.  After hanging out at the lake we had all started to turn back.  After a while we decided to race down the hill off the trail back to camp. (last one there was cooking).  I hung back with another friend to just walk back and carry people's gear.  Shortly after everyone took off like a bat out of hell, we saw something jump between two trees.  The figure was stretched out like someone doing a jumping-jack while jumping in a lunge.  It must have been at least 6 feet tall.  At first we thought it was my brother messing with us, he was the only one in our group tall enough.  Both me and my friend have a lot of outdoor experience.  It was positively not a deer, sheep, elk or a bear.  Although it's color was very similiar to the light-grey of a mule deer during that time of year.  The arms were clearly visible as were the legs, but it moved very fast between the trees.  At first we joked about how it looked like a bigfoot creature, but blew it off as my brother.  When we got back to camp everyone else was there and we noticed that my brother had a red shirt on, and was the second one back at camp.  It rained that night and was a steep hike so we never went back to look for tracks.",

  "location_details": "(I'd like to note that I'm not sure it's Huerfano county....Alamosa is on the other side of the mtn.) To get to Lilly Lake, you drive through Gardner, CO on Hwy 69 (west?).  Stay straight until you get to a fork on a dirt road.  Go left to Huerfano creek.  stay on the road for a good ways.  It turns into a 4x4 road after awhile and ends at the Lilly Lake trail head.  The trail then leads right to the lake (a good steep hike).  The sighting was very roughly about 1/3 of a mile down hill from the lake and 1/3 of a mile to the west off the trail in the trees.",
