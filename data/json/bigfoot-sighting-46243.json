  "observed": "While in flagstaff, AZ, my husband, mother-in-law, and I decided to take a chairlift ride. As we drove up snow bowl rd to reach the Arizona Snowbowl, we saw a large tall figure walking in long strides through the trees. I would say about 40 yards from the desolate road. As an avid \"Finding Bigfoot\" watcher, our sighting was everything we heard/saw on the show. The squatch had to have been at least 8 or 9 feet tall. It was too far away to make out any features, but the way it walked, the posture, and dark brown/black color it was unmistakeable. Definitely not a bear or deer. We saw the creature take two long strides through the trees and \"disappear\". A feeling came over us of shock/fear/amazement. I had goosebumps all over my body.",
