  "observed": "On July 10, 1:45 am in our camp site of Taylor Park between the towns of Lyons and Mill City Oregon. My family and I were camping for our final night when 3 of us were awakened by a scream like howl that sounds 100% exactly like the Klamath recording it screamed twice right after a siren went off. At that moment we knew it was like nothing any of us ever heard before so when we arrived home searching for the sounds of cougars mountain lions and bigfoot as well we finally came accross your site and knew positively that it was bigfoot. The hair on our bodies arose as if we were there again hearing it all over again and the fear over took me and I began to cry again from what we know now was Bigfoot.",
