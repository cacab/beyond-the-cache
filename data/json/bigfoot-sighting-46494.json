  "observed": "I was taking a bike ride along Des Plaines River in 08/67. I was very tired so I sat down on this fallen log and was watching the river. Across the river in the dark shadows of the forest a shadowy figure emerged. I watched it closely while it was splashing in the water like it was looking for fresh water clams or crayfish. It scared me because it was covered with a thick coat of hair like an ape. It resembled a cross between an ape and and a cave man. As I watched it thru the ragweed and cat tails which hid me I cleared my throat and coughed. It looked all around and seemed to be agitated. I kept sitting on the log because I lost sight of the creature. All of a sudden three huge rocks were tossed from the river toward me.They were the size of throw pillows. Moved out with my bike around the cat tail blind and saw it face to face. I yelled wow! It was moving into the cat tails for it crossed the river without a sound. Upon seeing me it picked up more rocks and hurled them at me. It was muscular black brown In color with mud on its face very wrinkled skin. It had bulging eyes and a pushed in nose. I ran as fast as I could along the game trail along the river. As I ran I heard a howl that sounded like an air raid siren. As I ran I heard screaming and saw shadowy figures on other side of river moving. Bigfoots? I got to the parking lot on East River road and left.",
