  "observed": "I live on 1010 Highway near the Johnston County Airport. Its kind of a country road , couple swampy areas and such, a good hunting area you could say. I was on my way back from the beach at my dad's house, my sister was with me. I'm 24 she's only 15. Anyway, I just turned out of the local BBQ place for some food (White Swan open 24 hrs) to head home. I got past the local livestock building, and turned onto 210 Hwy, drove about 3-4 minutes, turned onto 1010 or Cleveland Rd. There was an old car parked on the side of the road, so I could hardly see to turn left, so when I did, I drove for maybe 10-15 seconds when I saw eyes in front of me (it was about 9:15 in the PM) I turned lights on bright and I thought it was a homeless man walking along the road, but seeing someone walking down here when its dark is unlikey, I slow down ,I didn't know if it was gonna cross the road , I was driving about 35  in a 45 mph zone. As I got closer I noticed it was not a man, it was something else, like a bear walked up right with long legs and arms longer than a man, had dark hair, I couldn't really see the color very well. He was about as big as my grandfather and he is 6' 11'' . I was speechless, and my sister was scared to death because our house is 1 minute from where he was at. That night I couldn't sleep and the next morning I got up and went back there, no foot prints or anything because it is so dry here from no rain.I haven't seen it since but it's only been a few days",
