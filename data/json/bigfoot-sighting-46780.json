  "title": "Possible nighttime sighting while driving over a bridge near Charlemont",

  "observed": "Approx. summer of 2000, I was on Negus Mountain in Rowe, MA (Franklin County) with my wife, sitting on the tailgate...we heard something in the woods, about 100 yards away, walking towards us.  As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it's a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more. Fast Forward to 2006, I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield, MA.  I remember I was running a little late, so I was probably speeding, and the time would have been 2230ish.  It was raining lightly.  In West Charlemont, at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension, there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.  It was about 6, maybe 6 and a half feet tall, had long brown hair all over it's body, and was stock still.  I drive this route almost daily (or nightly, in my case) for over 12 years, I know what belongs and what doesn't.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back, and it was gone.  Being late for work, I turned around again and went to work.  I have never had any doubt that I saw a Sasquatch.  I haven't reported it because I don't want people to think I am a crackpot.  I just recently told my father about it, who told me to look into any organizations such as yours.",
