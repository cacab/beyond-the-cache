  "observed": "I teach in the city of Galesburg, Knox County Illinois in the summer months.  It was late July or early August when I saw this animal run in front of my car.  It was dusk when my daughter and I were driving on what is known as Old highway 34 (Illinois Route 164) west of Galesburg, Illinois heading for Monmouth, Illinois. I was right by the Knox / Warren county line. I had just driven over a little bridge that covered a small creek or farm run off.  This bridge was down in a little lower area then the rest of the land and as I came over the bridge and started around a little curve an animal ran in front of my car.  It was about 15 yards in front of my vehicle.  Since it was not quite dark, my headlights did not illuminate the animal well, yet it was still light enough to see the creature.  The creature was very dark and hairy it was running on all fours, yet it was very tall.  Its rear end was up higher than its front end and it appeared to have no muzzle.  Its face was flat. This creature had a most awkward gate for the speed it was actually achieving.  Its front legs moved as if a human would be leaning over a tricycle peddling and its back legs moved with a human running motion including what appeared to be knees. My daughter, unfortunately did not see it and that was very disappointing for her and me. The animal ran so quickly across the road that by the time I was able to say something it was gone.  We turned around to see if we could see it off the side of the road but in Illinois that time of the year it's impossible.  Tall corn, tall grass, soy beans, bushes and trees.",
