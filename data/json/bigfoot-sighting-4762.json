  "observed": "This is the second time I've seen one. The first was at a campground about 20 years ago by Mohican state park (Ohio).  I left the campfire to check on the kids. We were camping with a few other families and the tents were basically in a circle.  As I passed the tent next to mine there was what i take to be a young bigfoot (about my height, which is 5'7\") I would call it grayish brown, not like an ape, the facial features were flatter, more like a person's (not the big jaw an ape has). I stopped dead in my tracks and it stared at me and I stared at it. It frightened me since I didn't expect to see it but it never moved, giving me the impression it was just as scared. I went back to the fire and it disappeared. The second time was two nights ago.  It has been very hot the last few days so I was staying up later to do wash and put it in the dryer.  It was about 11:45 pm I was loading the dryer and glanced up at the open window to see a head and shoulders and the top of the back walking past the window. The window is about 6 feet off the ground so I guess it was roughly 7 feet tall.  It evidently bumped into something on the way because it knocked into the house. Personally I hate seeing it.  It scares me even if they are supposed to be harmless.   The second one was the same color, grayish brown, hairy, straight hair but obviously fur rather than human hair, more coarse looking. I don't tell people because they think you are nuts.  However a friend of mine has seen them a number of times looking in her windows (she lives 5 -10 miles from me but due east) she lives in Windsor in Ashtabula county, I live in Geauga county in Claridon (Ohio)",

They recently began building in some of the woods but it would still be somewhat small town, bordering on rural",
