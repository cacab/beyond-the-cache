  "observed": "On June 1,2002  I checked out animal tracks on a muddy curve near Danbury, Wisconsin.  I soon noticed a 17 1/4 inch human like footprint. So drove into town to purchase a camera and casting material. Before leaving the find area I tossed some apples from the car into the brush at the site. Returning there after about one hour in town and driving. I took photos of the footprint and surrounding area. I then began to cast the print. While doing this a commotion of rustling bushes started up nearby. It appearred to do so without benefit of much wind. So I stood up apprehensibly and looked in that direction. As I stepped back to get a better look the rustling\"bushes shot twenty feet in the air accompanied by a loud crack. Where upon the top of a birch tree that had been pulled down and shaken fell to the shoulder of the road within a few feet of me. That was followed by three or four whinny type vocalizations very close by in the woods. The sound did not appear to be a threatening one but rather a mischievious chuckle of some type. Days later the outline of a bigfoot creature was found on one of the photos. I am with holding that photo until I can authenticate it thoroughly. The figure stood about seven feet or so  and on several other occasions following June 1st  made himself known to me by following me as I checked the road for further footprints{none \"castable\" found] . Creature appearred to cross the road in three places,each where the stream nearby passed close to the road. Either to avoid being seen in the water or to avoid areas where modern day trappers put beaver sets. Creature travels otherwise exclusively in the water for which he is perfectly evolved.Think about it ,the wide feet, the up then straght down step, the weight to anchor against current s ,the height to still spot danger and long arms to reach down ,not up!. To scoop up the crayfish and things IN THE WATER>.",
