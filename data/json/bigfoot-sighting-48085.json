  "observed": "On October 20th 1979 we saw a dark form cross the road as we headed out grouse hunting in Marionette county. It crossed where there were no roads or house. It was one solid color not carrying any gun or fishing rod. The time was approximately 6:45 a.m.  Back then my dad had doubts about it as we were traveling with my dad, brother and I and at the time my brother and I thought it was a Bigfoot. However, 30 years later my dad swears it was a bigfoot.",
