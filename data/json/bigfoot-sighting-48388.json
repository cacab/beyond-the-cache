  "observed": "Near Auburn Iowa. I was with three boys cruising the gravel roads, it was very late. It was summer around July corn was high. The two people in front were not paying attention as me and the other person saw cross the road a very big black hairy animal. It had a very arched back, it walked or strides were strange. The face was sort of dog like but it was hard to see it real good in detail because it was dark and a quick look. The legs I remember bent back. All I know is it was not anything normal or that anyone knows of, it was very scary looking .I was, and the person next to me in complete shock by what we had seen.",
