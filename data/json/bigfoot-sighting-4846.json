  "observed": "What I saw was a thing about 6 foot tall, all black and short hair, its body was skinny and its forearms were bigger than its biceps. It was leaning over, drinking out of a stream by the path I was walking on. It had to be very strong because wen I came walking by, it stood up on two legs very fast and grabbed on to the tree behind it to help it up the hill. This thing I saw almost looked like a monkey except way too tall to be a monkey and also way to skinny to be a bear and too fast.",

  "location_details": "Where I saw this thing was on the outside of Philomath when you're leaving and there's a road to King's Valley.  You take that right and on that road take another right and down that road there's an old abandoned mill and beside that there's a pond and a path. If you take the path, you will see that there are little areas of connecting streams that run off the pond. I saw it drinking out of one of them.",
