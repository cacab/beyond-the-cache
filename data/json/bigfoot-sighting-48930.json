  "observed": "I need to speak to someone personally about my incident right away. I was walking alone through the Lost Forty scientific natural area near Dora Lake MN on this past Wednesday the 3rd of June 2015. Around 12 o'clock noon. Just last week as I was taking pictures of the 350 year old white pines with my camera phone. My Dad was back in the car and he honked the horn and yelled at me to come back as he was getting impatient as always. I immediately heard strange unexplainable sounds after he honked the horn. I believe he startled whatever it was back there because the sounds were getting louder after he honked the horn. I was deep in the forest and you could hear a pin drop. The sounds I heard were absolutely unexplainable for me to write down. It sounded like there must be a 500 pound woodpecker back here banging into some trees. I didn't think anything of it because nothing really scares me. I carried on, taking many beautiful pictures of the untouched white pines deep into the Lost Forty scientific and natural area. 15 minutes after my hike,I heard a tree starting to loudly crack and fall within 20 maybe 30 feet from where I was standing still. Startled, I looked all around 360 degrees to make sure it didn't fall on top of me. Just less than 20 to 30 feet away this GIANT birch tree flung back up into the air in its original upright position. The path was curved so I couldn't see around the next corner on the ground. I had less than 5 seconds as my mind was running through all the possibilities of what just happened. I have never been so afraid in my entire life and nothing ever really scares me. I thought it may be a bear at first but that tree was so big I almost ruled it out right away. I immediately ran for my life in the opposite direction as fast as humanly possible about a quarter mile back to the car. I was afraid whatever it was had been chasing me. It wasn't thank God, because halfway to the car I had to stop and catch my breath for about a minute. It seemed like I ran forever and I thought this was the end of me. As I was running back to the car my Dad heard me running through the forest huffing and puffing, and he thought I was just messing with him. He told me that \"I looked like I had just seen a ghost and, what the hell just happened?\". I drove away from that place going about 80 miles an hour. Couldn't barely breath for a half hour. I have never heard or seen or experienced anything like this in my whole life. I did not personally see it, but it saw me and must have climbed up a large birch tree causing it to bend down and crack as the creature fell to the ground. As I described the event to other people and some locals throughout the week, some said it was not a bear. They told me to watch your show on tv. I am watching your TV show for the first time now while I'm typing this. I have never seen your show before today. And as I see those people in your Base camp episode. I'm realizing I was only a half hour drive away from most of those incidents. We have a summer home in Blackduck MN. I was up there for my annual fishing trip, I live in Rockford IL. So I am very far away from where it happened right now. If you are looking for a sasquatch I suggest you head to the Lost Forty scientific natural area (SNA) in Northern Minnesota. I'm never going back there alone. Maybe for the right reasons if there were people with firearms with me. And I hope you guys please contact me by phone right away.This was only a few days ago so every detail is fresh in my mind still.",
