  "observed": "My wife was going to use the outhouse just before light on Memorial Weekend. She proceeded to go around the cabin to the north as the outhouse is in back of the cabin to the west. There is a group of three small trees that we have converted to a counter and about 6-7 feet on the other side was a Pewter or dark gray \"thing\". It was walking on two feet very rapidly and she caight a glimps out of the side of her eye. She claims it made noise and had no smell. She woke me and I found nothing. We have heard screams and wood being struck for many years and several other sighting have been made by our guests and people that live along the road.",
