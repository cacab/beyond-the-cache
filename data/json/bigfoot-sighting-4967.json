  "observed": "I am a night owl. A few weeks back, I was working on my computer, it was about 2 in the morning. I live in an apartment complex on east side of Kent, Ohio. Next to the complex, there are alot of woods that run back for quite a bit. I usually have my windows open as well. It was pretty quiet that night, all of a sudden, I heard a loud bang, like something hit something else, followed by 3 or 4 loud yelling noises that were not human or a house pet. It was very differnt. I have attended a seminar by Robert Morgan, and from what he described as a yell that a bigfoot might make, it sure sounded like it. I am being dead serious about this.",
