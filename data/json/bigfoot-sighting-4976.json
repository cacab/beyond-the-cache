  "observed": "I was 18 then just out of high school and was camping with friends behind my parents house in the Shawnee forest. I remember now that one of my friends said that he felt as though we were being watched and he was very uncomfortable and didn't leave the area of the fire much. We had heard something moving across the field from where we were camped and I wanted to see what it was. There were many small apple trees in this field and I went down and sat under one so I could see the other side of the field with out the glare of the fire. The moon was bright that night and afforded a fairly good look at what was going on. Along the tree line was a possible sasquatch walking slightly hunched over but looking toward the camp fire and the camp area in general. I remember his eyes flashing red as the fire would reflect in them. I refer to it as a him simply for the fact that I assumed that it was the same from the first sighting years before and had now evident breasts. It cleared the field in very short time and headed into a small ravine. We didn't hear it or see it again. This was in October of 1990. Seemed to be between 7 and 7 1/2 feet tall. Dark hair color most likely black or a very dark brown. The head came to a slight point at the top, eyes seemed smallish and would reflect red at night. Chest was large and barrel like, arms longer than that of a man, stout thick legs. Nose was broad and flat and mouth jutted out slightly, ape like. One thing I do remember is that when it turned and walked away that the hair on it's hind quarters was thinner and that it's butt was visible. First sighting- 1980 I was young anywhere from 8-10 years old, I was awakened one morning by the sounds of our dogs baying and running around the house and under the porch. I got up and looked out my window to see this creature standing in the edge of the forest, roughly 70 feet away across a small stream and the road. I watched it for what seemed like forever but was probably only a minute or two at the most before it casually turned and walked back into the woods and up the hill. Late fall is when this took place.",
