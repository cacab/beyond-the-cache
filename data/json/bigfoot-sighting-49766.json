  "observed": "My grandson and I had driven up to East Fork Lake to take pictures of deer. They come out in the evening to graze near the lake. We took a few photos of the deer then decided to leave because it was getting dark. As we were leaving the park (two lane road with heavy woods on both sides of road), I had been talking to him (he was driving and I was in the passenger seat) when I turned my head forward and noticed something a short distance in front of us next to the side of the road. There was something tall and very dark that was hard to make out. As we slowly passed it I could finally see it and realize it was a Sasquatch. It was very large with a chest about 3 feet wide and stood about 7 to 8 feet tall. It was not moving, it was just standing there looking down the road from whence we had just come. I said to my grandson \"what was that‚Äù and he could not answer. We kept driving out of the park too afraid to turn around and go back. It had come out of the woods and was probably getting ready to cross into the heavy woods across the road. That animal was huge and looked very powerful. I was shocked because it is a busy park but with a lot of deer and people with picnics. I forgot to mention it was late, somewhere around 8 PM, the sun had already gone down but we were still able to make out object from the twilight.",
