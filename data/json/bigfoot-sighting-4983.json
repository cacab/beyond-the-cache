  "observed": "I was staying the night with a friends of mine. It was late at night we were watching TV waiting on his parents to come home. We heard a noise out front and I looked out the window in the door to the mobile home. A large face was looking in the window. The face had a very heavy brow with deepest eyes, the nose was wide and flat with flared nostrils. The lips were thick and rubbery looking with thick block like teeth. The hair was about one inch long on the face and it sweptback from the brow with a large lump standing up on the top of the head. The head sat on the shoulders with no sigh of a neck. It let out a scream and it pushed off from the door. My friend grabbed his 22 rifle and we went out the back door in time to see it step NOT JUMP but step over a 3 strand barb wire fence and run in a hunched over motion with it's arms swinging it's hands below it's knees. The next day we looked for tracks but found none. We did measured the distance from the ground to the window of the door (there was no front steps) 7'6\".",
