  "observed": "I was working as a Deputy Sheriff in Adams County. I was traveling North on U.S. 95 About 10 miles north of Council well after dark. I was headed to an accident scene at high speed  with lights and siren.  A large hairy creature came up the embankment in front of my car, crossed the road and went up the embankment on the opposite side of the road. I have no idea how fast I was traveling, but if this had been a normal forest animal I would have hit it before it completed its crossing of the road. I couldn't really tell what it was except that it walked on two legs and had dark fur.",
