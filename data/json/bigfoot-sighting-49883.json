  "observed": "It was August of 1977 and I had missed my ride home from Hacketstown NJ to Byram NJ. The road to get back to Byram is Waterloo Rd. It was about 9:30-10:00 PM so I decided to hitch hike it on Waterloo hoping that someone would give me a lift back to HWY-206. It was very dark and as I was walking past Stephens State Park and then the old Saxton Falls area, I could hear something that sounded like it was on 2 feet stalking me in the woods on the ridge side of Waterloo Rd. It got very interesting when I started sprinting, it also started sprinting keeping up with me for what seemed like at least a mile. When I would walk, it would walk. It was loud as it went thru the woods as I stayed on the road hoping for a car to pick me up. Eventually I did get a ride near a few houses after passing an old Tavern on the river side of Waterloo Rd.",
