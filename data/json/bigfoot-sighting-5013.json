  "observed": "We had built a new two story cabin and had some friends down to play music and camp overnight. We were playing music and one lady decided that she would go to a smaller cabin and retire for the night. We had discussed the sighting that my wife had a couple years ago and this lady was completely unaffected and thought we were crazy. She made some fun of my wife about the situation. The lady open the back door and we heard a scream and I ran out fearing she had fallen. She was nearly hysterical and said \"I saw It.\" As she was going to the other cabin, a large gray creature was standing near my truck near the drivers door. She couldn't estimate the height but believed it was six to seven foot tall. She didn't give any details on the shape of it or anything else. I was out the door no more than 10 second after the scream and saw, smelled or heard nothing. We called a local investigator over to investigate but neither he nor my son could find anything. The lady was still shaking the next afternoon when they returned home. I can't saw what she saw but it effected her deeply. Two years later she refuses to talk about the incident and turns away.",
