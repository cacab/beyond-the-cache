  "observed": "In June 2015, I, my wife, and son, were out at 10:00pm south of Pryor near low water dam on the Neosho river. As we drove the back roads, I stopped my truck and immediately heard a loud \"ape like\" sound coming from the tree line that was appropriately 15 yards to our left. We shone a light in the area for about a minute. I back my truck up 20 feet and stopped and we heard a second louder \"ape like\" sound from a second location in the tree line. The \"ape like\" sound was a short whooping noise. The second noise was loader and more aggressive sounding than the first noise. We stayed in the area for several hours with no other incident.",
