  "observed": "Hi..i was driving down TT 62 coming from Salem Ohio about 7 pm dusk on October 20 2015 with my 16 year-old daughter.. we were almost to an intersection of freeway entrance and out of the corner of my eye coming from the left side I notice movement then saw a brown leg..at first i thought it was a deer, I have almost hit several in this area. So I started breaking preparing for a deer to jump out but instead a full leg then body came out and stepped in my sight into the road..as I looked I realized it was a bigfoot creature about 8 foot tall covered in long brown fur, very thin. It did not look at me but took the road in two more steps and was across and gone into the woods beside a home's driveway..it happened so quick it was surreal .All I could do was look at my daughter whose face was in total shock..she started saying .oh my god mom that was really a bigfoot..I cant believe we just saw an actual bigfoot.. she called my sister to tell her... it was not dark yet .",
