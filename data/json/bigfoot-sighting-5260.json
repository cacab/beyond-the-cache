  "observed": "My family and I were heading up north to meet my grandparent for salmon fishing. My father was pulling our trailer and had to pull over for some reason. We all got out and we were told to stand away from the road. My sister looked down into a little valley where a river was running. She had said look at those. As we all looked down we notice there were large footprints in the sand along the river and leading to the east, uphill toward the forest edge. As we talked about what they might be we all heard some noise coming from the top of the ridge on the other side of the river. Thats when we saw just for a moument a large creature walking on two feet over the ridge and out off sight. We jumped back into the car and drove off. I may have only have been 8 but I remember it clearly.",
