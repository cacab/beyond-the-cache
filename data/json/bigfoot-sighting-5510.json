  "observed": "At the time, I lived in Umatilla, Florida.I used to work on CB radios and such and occasinally a deputy would stop by my little shop at my house and we would shoot the bull. One nite a deputy stopped and said they had a Bigfoot sighting in the Ocala National forest, and being the curious type, I asked where and he told me. The next morning 6/30/1980, I got a friend of mine and decided to go and see if we could find the prints. We stopped at the hardware store and I bought, some plaster of paris. Already had the buckets in the Jeep. When we arrived we could see where casts had previously been taken, we decided to look further. So, we drove further thru the woods and had to cross a pretty deep creek to get to the other side, where the road continued, if you want to call it a road. I stopped the jeep and we got out to look around and LOW AND BEHOLD, there were prints coming from a clear cut area (where trees have been cut down and removed), across the sandy road and leading into the swamp. It had stopped at the edge of the road and must have eaten bay tree blossoms because up about 10 to 12 feet in the tree you could see where it took the blossoms and there were pieces of the blossoms on the ground. The prints were about 4 to 5 feet apart when it walked, and about 1 to 2 inches deep. As I walked or tried to walk in its stride, it was a stretch for me as I'm a pretty big man myself, 6ft.3in. I actually put my foot in its prints as i walked deeper into the swamp. The further I got the deeper the prints went into the ground and my foot and leg went all the way to my groin area, this thing was BIG. I took 2 casts and gave one to my buddy and I kept one, which I still have.There is NO DOUBT IN MY MIND after seeing what I saw and casting the prints that this DOES EXIST.",
