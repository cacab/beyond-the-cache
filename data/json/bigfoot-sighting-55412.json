  "observed": "I was 12 or 13 at the time. We had been rock climbing and repelling on the cliffs there. We had been there several times before. I had a habit of wandering off exploring. I had walked the cliff top probably a half mile away from the group I was with. I was in a very thick area in a cut or a hollow that has an overhang. Looking down you could see an undercut in the cliff. I was on top, looking across, trying to figure out if I needed to go around the top or climb down. I heard something below that sounded like some low grunts and heavy rocks rolling around. i got closer to the edge and looked over and saw \"something.\" It was very large and I could only see its back. It was very wide with no neck. I could see its head but it did not have much neck. I could see its shoulders and back and the shoulders were very wide. It was completely covered with hair. It was crouched over and rolling the big rocks over like it was looking for something underneath. I heard some low grunts but nothing else other than the rocks rolling around. Its color was a color I can only say looked like a dark grayish brown not unlike a coyote. it was big but I never really saw it stand up and I never really saw its face. I did see its arms as it pulled up on the rocks rolling them around but I was so startled and scared I turned and ran. As i took off, it seemed to move away as well but it was 40-50 feet below me in the hollow. It was not a wild pig because it was clearly crouched down on two legs and using its arms and hands to roll the rocks. I ran all the way back to the group. I remember hyperventalating on the way back from being scared and thinking for sure it was chasing me. I told my father that I saw something but he didn't react much at all. He told me I shouldn't have wandered off. Years later when I brought it up, he told me that he had a similar experience in the same general area.",
