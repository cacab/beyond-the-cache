  "observed": "At approximately 7 PM on Wednesday, November 16, Jon E., Dan F., Dan W. and James O. and I met at my house to watch a Philadelphia 76er's game.  While watching, Dan F. noticed a human-like creature walking in the street in front of my house.  From the living room window, we all observed a creature which appeared to be just under six feet tall walking away from my house.  The creature was about 150 feet away and passed under a street light, which gave us the ability to get a decent look at it.  It was long limbed, but clearly not human.  Because of the lighting it was in silhouette, but we could see that it was covered with hair.  It was walking with its shoulders hunched forward, and did not appear to be in any distress.  We watched it pass from view as it went behind trees and into the woods on the far side of the street. I live in a quiet neighborhood that is located in a wooded area.  My house is on a street that is a cul-de-sac, and there is very little traffic.  There is a quarry less than a quarter mile away through the woods.  In the 14 years that I have owned this house, I have routinely heard animal calls that can't be identified as dog barks, etc., and have seen droppings and footprints in the woods that have not been from any animal such as a deer, etc., that would be seen in this area. This is the first instance in which I have seen a creature that I believe is a bigfoot.  Because we were all shocked by what we saw, we did not attempt to pursue this creature, but we were able to observe it for 5-7 seconds before it passed from view. In the minutes that followed, we all discussed what we saw.  While my friends, who do not live in this neighborhood, were initially reluctant to acknowledge that it was a bigfoot, after I explained the things that I have heard and seen around my house over the years, we all agreed that the creature was not human, and clearly fit the description of a bigfoot.  Please contact me so I can provide further information about this sighting.",
