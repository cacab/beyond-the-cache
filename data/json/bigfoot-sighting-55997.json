  "observed": "I believe to have a very large creature that comes and goes off my property of 50 acres just outside of city of Eldon. Part of my property has unusual broken over trees as well as what appears to be small dens where cedar trees are pulled over and bent to the ground with other limbs busted and placed on top of cedars many new breaks of cedars and other large shrubs in same area have appeared this summer in same area of property. My family and I as well as our neighbors have heard wood knocks come from that area. My son and I were both spooked by a very loud roar like noise one evening, and one night seen a large creature moving through the field.",
