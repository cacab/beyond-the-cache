  "observed": "This is in reference to report #3777, its occurance was in Pineville, Lousiana. I believe that throughout the course of my life, (I'm 27 now), I have encountered this \"bigfoot\" twice, possibly three times in three different states. My second encounter was when I also lived in Pineville, La! In a log cabin on the Donahue Ferry road to be exact. It was 1985 watching TV show  of Haleys comet. It was fairly late ( I was eleven and it was way past my bedtime) in the evening. There was almost no moon as I stood out in the back yard looking up at the sky to see the comet. The house had a large yard bordered by a pine forest on two sides. As I looked up at the sky I was startled to death by an EXTREMELY loud scream that came from the very edge of the forest aboout 100 feet away. I immediately started running back up a small hill toward my house when the high pitched scream blasted my ear drums again. The whole time I was running toward the house (75 feet away), I kept my eyes focused on the origination of the sound coming from the forest edge. While running, I slipped and lost my balance a little (as a result of not watching where I was going). When I did this, it seemed to startle what I could now see as a very large upright creature standing in the shadows. It had been there the whole time, I just didn't see it because it hadn't moved until I slipped. Its head came to the bottom branches of the trees that it was standing next to. I ran inside and told my father who dismissed it as a screech owl from the comfort of his lazy boy. I honestly don't know how he DIDN'T hear the scream. The next day I went out to the tree and, with some scrap wood, climbed up it and sat in the branch that was closest to its head. I remember sitting there with my legs dangling thinking that it was too high for me to just jump straight down.",
