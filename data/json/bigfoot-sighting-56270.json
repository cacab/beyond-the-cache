  "observed": "I did not see anything just heard. I was out hunting in an area called Brooks Marsh, after walking a fair bit around the marsh on the trail about 4 miles. I came across a turtle shell that had been crack in half  as if it had been picked up and slit in one go. I went just a bit further to where the trail split and sat down to wait for deer before I got to my spot I saw another turtle that had been cracked around like taking the chocolate off the outside of a reese's cup. After setting in one place I started to hear oooop it was different tones in five different spots, 2 down below me to my left rear, 2 off to my right along the road and, 1 further down almost to the end of the marsh. The loader of the ooop was from the one at the end of the marsh and to two to my left. The 2 along the road sounded as if lower tones and up in the trees. I stayed there for about 15 minutes listening, some of the sounds vibrated through the valley. I stood up and headed for my rig when everything went dead silent no sound from anywhere but what I made. I walked along the trail for about a 100 yards I heard a crack as if a baseball bat hit a bat with a wosh, wosh, wosh and hitting the brush. Because I was hunting deer and nothing larger I continued on my way. I felt as if I had went the other way I would have seen something.",
