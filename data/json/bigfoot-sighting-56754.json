  "timestamp": 1246406400,
  "observed": "In summer of 2009, I believe I saw something that to me, was a Bigfoot. I was down at deep creek near Lake Arrowhead, Ca and I spotted something moving, very tall, standing atop a huge boulder about a mile away. I got a picture of it, but it was so far away that its a terrible photo. Everyone with me saw it, but specualted that it was just a person. Now this area where the \"thing\" was was very far away, so Im still not sure what I saw, but that exact spot was way out in the middle of nowhere.",
