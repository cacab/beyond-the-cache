  "observed": "Traveling west on Highway 60 out of Brazos County TX into Burleson County TX , 200-300 yards after crossing the Brazos river I seen a large dark object on the side of the road. I was traveling about 80mph,so I passed it rather fast, this dark object rose up to a standing position and took a leap into the darkness. I was raised in the mountains of upstate South Carolina, hunted and fished all over from Montana to Argentina. I've seen all kinds of animals,  but I have never in my life seen anything like this. The river and areas has been severely flooded as Hurricane Harvey just came though this area, over 30 inches of rain in 2 days. I never really believed there were bigfoot, if so why has no one found a body or bones, or God forbid shot one of these beings.  Well I am here to tell you, I now am a believer and it doesn't bother me if people call me a liar or crazy. I have nothing to gain from this and frankly don't care what anyone says, I know what I saw and I am now a believer that bigfoot is real, no doubt what so ever......",
