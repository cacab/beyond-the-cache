  "observed": "As I approached a wooded area near the McCreary County-Whitley County line. I saw something move in the distance on the side of the road. Thinking it might be Deer that would dart out in front of me, I slowed down a bit. As I got closer I was astonished to see that whatever it was, was about 7 feet tall with Gray hair that covered the entire body. It turned toward me and it's eyes were large and seemed to be a reddish color. The thing ranted around like it was angry or something and I floored the vehicle. I was scared to death and I immediately drove to my cousin's house to calm down and tell him what had happened. I've traveled that road alot and never saw anything like that. I had a clear shot of the thing and was fairly close. I'm not one to usually believe these stories but this IS what I saw.",
