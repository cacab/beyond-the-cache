  "observed": "Myself and 11 hunting buddies were camping near Liberty Hill.  We had been bow hunting in the area all day, since it was opening day.  Although other hunters were camping in the general area, we were alone at the meadow we were at. Late that night, around 2:00 a.m., something ran through our camp screaming.  We all woke up with a jump, scrambling for our guns.  Whatever it was, was so heavy that it shook my truck as it ran by.  It knocked over a full ice chest trying to get out of the camp.  I was sleeping in the back of my truck but I couldn't see anything in the dark.  The scream was a very high pitched, female-like scream. I have been a hunter for a long time and we have never heard anything like that.  The next morning, we didn't see any unusual prints, so we never figured out what it was. As a side note, I still hunt in the area every year and nothing unusual has ever happened since.",
