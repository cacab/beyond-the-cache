  "observed": "I believe that i saw bigfoot, with two other witnesses in the vehicle with me.  I seen a huge ape like animal that was reddish brown color, with long straggley looking hair hanging off it's arms, and legs.  I also noted as it walked, its legs at the knees were bent as it walked its legs never straightened out like a humans legs would. The arms of this bigfoot were long and swayed as he walked and he was very tall, i noted that he walked next to a tall sign on the highway and his shoulders were in line with the 55 mile speed limit highway sign on hwy 299. I would also say that this creature was around 7 to 8 foot in height, and about 500lbs, or more in weight.",
