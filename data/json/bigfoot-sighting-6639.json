  "observed": "My wife, my two children, and I were driving on Hwy 50, west bound, leaving South Lake Tahoe at 9:55 PM.  We just passed the agriculture inspection station in the town of Meyers, CA, when both my wife and I saw simultaneously a large animal crossing the road about 100 yards in front of us.  I thought it was a bear but wasn't sure.  So I asked my wife.  Her response was most unusual. She said that she saw it walking on two legs and that it looked like a monkey, about 5 1/2 feet tall, with light brown fur.  She has better eye sight than me so I questioned her further.  \"What else did you notice,\" I asked, very curious.  She said that it had walked rather slowly, across the road, and that it was definately an animal, like a monkey, and walked like a monkey would walk. It disappeared into the trees, before we could get close enough for a better look.  I wanted to turn around and look some more but my wife didn't want to.  So we kept driving.  That's when I had a chance to question her more. My wife has had Laser surgery on her eyes, and I wear corrective lenses, which, most unfortunately I wasn't wearing at that moment.  This is why she was able to see better than me.",
