  "observed": "It was in Cave Junction, OR in the late 1970's. My family was visiting my grandparents who lived there at the time. My family, (dad, mom, 2 sisters and brother) were sleeping in a tent trailer. My sister and I slept on the side that overhangs the trailer hitch, when early one morning the 2 of us were awaken to something scratching the bottom of our bed. Then it was scratching the tent part above us. Then the three sides of our bed. Neither of us said a word, but moved quietly to the zipper where the window was. We slowly unzipped it and were instantly assaulted with an awful smell. We saw dark brown fur up against the mesh and the scratching was once again above us. We quietly got out of bed and woke my parents, but by the time we got them up and they went outside it was gone. We figure that the movement of the trailer scared whatever it was off. We were positive it was bigfoot. The trailer was parked on the pavement so there was no way to know if there was foot prints anywhere. My parents and grandparents never spoke of whatever they found or didn't find that day.",
