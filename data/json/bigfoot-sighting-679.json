  "observed": "While I was a Marine stationed at one of the schools demostration camps in Quantico VA I observed something that looked like a bear while walking my post, what alerted me was a dog that use to walk post with whoever was on duty at night, when she started to bark I looked up and saw a figure that was about 7 feet tall had light brownish hair on it's body, was not able to see the face due to the darkness of the wooded area, but when I told the dog to go after it, the figure just stayed there and didn't move, but when I put a round in the chamber of my M1 it took off running, I never saw it after that, I asked some Marines that came from that area if there was an animal that looked like my description and their remark was, what did you have to drink, I really never paid any attention to the matter until years later I started to see stories of big foot, I am hoping that my story can confirm someone elses sighting in that area.",
