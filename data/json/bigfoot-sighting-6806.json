  "observed": "I have often thought I saw someone run  across the road while I deliver the paper. I often stopped to use the restroom in the same spot. I heard funny noises, but thought it was a bear or some other animal grunting and what not. Last night (about 4:30 AM actually, so this morning) I was stopped along the road looking over my route sheet, when out of the corner of my eye I saw someone walking. I slowly reached up and turned off the light. I put the car in gear, and looked over. What I saw made the hair stand on the back of my neck, and got tears in my eyes. It wasn't 7 feet tall, more like 6 feet or so -  I'm guessing, because it didn't seem to be bending over too far to look at me. It was maybe 5 or 6 feet away from my car. I was so frightened that I drove off as fast as I could. I called 911 and they thought I was a nut, and said it was most likely a vagrant, or homeless guy. I don't think so.",
