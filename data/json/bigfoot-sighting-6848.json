  "observed": "In the late 70s a friend of my fathers had a garage that was back in the woods a hundred yards or so from the road. One winter morning, he contacted my father to tell him that he found something strange around his garage. He proceeded to tell my father there were some very large footprints in the snow around his garage. My father, never one to believe in Bigfoot blew it off as a hoax or joke until he saw them with his own eyes. They were very large human-like footprints that came from a densely wooded area known as \"Goulds Hollow.\" He said they came out of the woods, walked around the garage, and back into the woods in the same place it came out of.",
