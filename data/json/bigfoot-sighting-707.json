  "observed": "I saw what I believe was a sasquatch about five years ago. I was sixteen years of age. I was volunteering as a counselor at a day camp.  A friend and I went for a walk on the trails within the camp, we were cleaning trails and we also brought our lunches which we planned to eat later.  We were on the outskirts of camp, maybe half mile from main camp, very close to the molalla river.  I was about 60 feet from a muddy creek, kind of a swampy area. I remember sitting down to eat lunch and my friend realized that he had left something back at camp that he needed.  I can't remember what he went to get, maybe a tool or something to drink.  So he left and I remained seated on a log waiting for him to come back.  I expected the jog to take maybe ten minutes.  He had been gone for at least seven minutes when I heard something in the woods to my left.  I stood up to get a better look at what it was.  What I observed was a massive hairy man-like animal standing next to a large tree (I think it was a cedar). It was about 50 feet away.  I estimate that it was about 8 ft tall.  I stood about 5 ft 9 in. at that time and it was far taller than me.  It was also very wide and bulky looking.  The fur was thick and fairly long, maybe 6 inches, and medium brown in color. It looked directly at me for a few seconds.  We had solid eye contact.  It had dark colored eyes.  It seemed to be shocked or surprised and was deciding what to do.  It stepped to it's right, my left, behind the large tree and immediately began to run away.  I could not see it run away because the tree blocked my view, but I definately heard it.  It sounded very heavy, the footsteps could be heard cleary.  It was snapping down branches as it ran, creating a lot of noise.  It sounded very powerful.  I listened to it run away for maybe ten seconds and then I turned around and ran back on the trail towards camp.  I met up with my friend on his way back to meet me.",
