  "observed": "My two brothers, cousin, and I were out playing a little war game with our toy guns. We ranged from the ages of  8 to 14 me being the oldest. We divided up in teams of two, my brothers were on a team and were going to go hide to which me and my cousin would try and find them after giving them some time to hide. We heard them scream and we stood up and were kinda worried because we were on the opposite side of the house than them. So we got up to make sure they were all right, but they came around the house before we could get to far. They went on to tell us that they heard something really big running in the thick patch of woods. My brother was going into the thicket to hide. When he started in that's when he heard something take off running. The sun was about to disappear as night grew nearer and he was still spooked from the noise he heard and refused to go hide anymore. I just thought that it was probably a deer since our area is very populated with them. So we got off the porch and was walking around the corner of the house when I looked up towards the road. Now to give you a brief description of the terrain. From where the thicket ends there is about 20 yards of short mowed grass which meets up with State Route 550 then on the other side of the road it slopes down fairly sharp and then into a cornfield. As it was striding across the road is where I saw it. It's arms were swaying back and forth and I remember the hair hanging from its arms. The body was very thick, thicker than any human body I've ever seen. The head looked like it ended in a point rather than a rounded head like a humans. It seemed to run in slow motion as I stood there in amazement. It went over the bank when it got to the other side of the road. We jumped up onto the porch and went inside to tell my dad. He just laughed at us and so have most people that I have told this to since then. I can still see that image in my head as if it just happened.",
