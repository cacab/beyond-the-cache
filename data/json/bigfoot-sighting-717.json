  "observed": "When I was 11 it happened on a Saturday night. The moon was full. I had my curtains closed. This creature walked up to my window. It was very tall and was covered with hair. It breathed heavily and it's head was kind of pointed on top. I also noticed that it almost seemed like it had no neck. It stood in front of my window for 2 or 3 minutes like it was listening and trying to look in. I knew it was no joke because we had no neighbors at the time. I was very scared of it. Eventually it left the window and walked around the side of the house. The next day I told my sister what I had seen that night and we discovered footprints around the house. they measured about 20 inches. I never told my parents because I didn't think they would belive me. We also measured the window and discovered that the creature had to be at least 8.5 feet tall. I know that whatever I saw scared me so badly that I wouldn't go outside at night untill I was 15. It also rained on that Sunday and washed away the footprints.We followed them into the woods.",
