  "observed": "Back east when I was about 14 around 1976 a buddy of mine and my self went out shooting our bb guns and we came across this old board up Carnation creamery. We being kids we broke in to this place it was at lest 150 years old.So we and started to look at this old milk wagon the old horse and buggy kind. After some time we came across this ladder that went to attic my friend being smaller then myself gave me his gun and said I want to take a look up there. As I watched him climb up the ladder and look inside, he yells down to me dude something up here smalls really bad. As I watch him turning around on the ladder.I see him stop turning and he jumps from the top step he comes right down next to me.I say what the heck did you do that for.and as he says he can see these hairy legs behind this box something big runs across the attic floor and breaks down this wall to the other side of the garage and runs across the roof and out in to a cornfeld. I can remember looking across the room out the window and seeing its reflection on the window next door to the place we were in. And it was big! it ran the distance of the building in 5 or 6 foot hops then through the wall. FUNNY thing about this the doors we tried to break in flew open and this little whirl wind comes in and stays right in the path of the cornfeld and we can see his path.",
