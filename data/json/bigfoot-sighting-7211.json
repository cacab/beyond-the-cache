  "observed": "In 1959 a friend and I went deer hunting in the hills above Marysville, California. At the time Beale Air Force Base was closed so we went on the base in the mountains. We camped out in the old barracks area that first night. My friend had his two retiever dogs with him. It was dark and we were in our bed rolls. We heard a very loud yelling - almost a scream - coming from the woods about a hundred yards away. The dogs went crazy and headed towards the wooded area. My friend and I grabbed our rifles and followed them. I have never heard a sound like that before. Just as we got a short distance away from the woods, we seen something that the dogs were running around. It was on two feet. It grabbed one dog, threw it some distance and swung on the other dog. I had it in the flashlight beam but couldn't see it too well. It turned towards us and my friend said that it had a face like that of an ape. It bounded into the trees and the dogs were called off by him. We did not stay there that night. About 6 years ago they had a program on TV that had recorded the noise believed to be Bigfoot. It was the same sound completely that we heard. At the time of this, I was stationed at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California. A year later I was stationed there at Beale.",

  "location_details": "Beale is an active Air Force Base now and has changed a lot. The area we were in was about three miles North East of the main part of the base. There were barracks there when the army had it for training. It was called Camp Beale and had some 80,000 acres. The army abandoned the camp many years before this took place. The Air Force reopened it in 1960. Go towards the mountains on base untill you see the thick forest area. I don't know if the barracks are still there or not. Likely not.",
