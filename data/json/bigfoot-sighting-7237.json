  "observed": "It was on thanksgiving night in 99. I was driving home from my daughters apartment in Cleveland Ga. When suddenly I thought I saw a man crossing the road on hwy. 75. I hit my brakes and realized that it was wearing no clothes and was covered in hair like a bear, but it walked upright and hunched more like a man or a huge ape like thing. It was definately not a bear. It was large and long armed. It turned it's head and looked over at me, then swiftly jumped down a huge drop and dissappeared into the woods. It all happened so fast. I was shocked and went home not sure of what i believed i had  seen at the moment. Before then I had never been sure something like that had existed and I tried to rationalize what I had seen, but now I am convinced that it was in fact neither man nor bear nor simple ape. I cannot prove what it actually was, but I can say that it was quite amazing. Either that night or the next morning I callerd Animal Control saying I saw a bear, believing that it wouldn't be taken serious if i said what i know I saw. There were cattle near by that needed protection.",
