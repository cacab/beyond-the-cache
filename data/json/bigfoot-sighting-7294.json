  "observed": "I had been working a swing shift at a paper press \"American Press\" from 3pm to 12 midnite, in the town of Mineral, VA (I think it was Mineral, in Louisa County.) About five of us were travelling home to Louisa, VA on not-too-isolated country road, when suddenly I saw something cross and go into the skinny forest at the side of the road. The first thing that struck me about it, was the way it moved. On a very primal level, I registered that it moved like nothing I had ever seen before; and my instinct on that primal level, was a gut-wrenching fear-reaction. Everything was happening very quickly, and the only light was from our headlights, but I noticed it was tall, and skinny, a dark figure with bad posture (a little hunched over.) Taller than any man I had ever seen, and I couldn't figure out why a man would be at that particular spot, as there was not much around, and it was midnight. I turned around to one of the people in the van and saw she was staring at the same spot and I said \"Did you see that?\" She said \"Yes.\" She didn't want to talk about it much, but I asked her what her first reaction was, and she said \"fear.\" When I asked her why, she said \"because of the way it moved, it looked like a killer.\" So then we talked about how something \"different\" would cause our first reaction to be fear, but the reaction soon after was of joy and wonder that we (older women, been there/done that) had truly seen something we had never seen before. It made us both smile, and I looked Bigfoot up on the internet the next day, as I had heard about sightings all across the US, but had never heard of them being around populated areas in the Virginia area.",
