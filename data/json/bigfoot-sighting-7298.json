  "observed": "Walking up to a stream to fish for German brown trout, we always try to be quiet as not to scare the fish . As we got around a 90 degree turn in the stream, we both saw what at first was a bear with its paws in the water. As it saw us, it stood up and looked to be around 7', we both knew it was not a bear as we have hunted black bear. We dropped our fishing poles and stared. I have hunted and fished in the high lakes in Oregon for a lot of years but have not been back to this stream since. I think this creature was as scared of us as we were of it. It watched us for about 20 second then turned and headed for the tree line but turned his head and watched us all the way to the trees, then stood and watched us for about a minute then in two big steps it was in the trees and gone.",
