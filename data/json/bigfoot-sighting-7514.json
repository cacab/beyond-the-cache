  "observed": "Original submission from Doug Pridgen. I have a tape you may want to see. It's that of a few friends drinking around a camp fire up state New York. The tape was shot in 1997 and not looked at until a year or two ago. My girlfriend was watching the TV while we were transfering the tape and said what is that in the tree? I had to rewind the tape ten or more times. I did not know what to make of it at first, but I knew it was not from the wilds of N.Y. state! At first, you think \"big monkey,\" but what the hell would a monkey be doing in the woods of N.Y.? The thing swings from one tree to the next and moves up and down it with ease! It hangs by one arm and pulls its self up and around in this tree at a speed you have to see. It looks to me to be about 5 to 5-1/2 feet in height, dark in color, very strong upper body and fast as hell in the trees.",
