  "observed": "I was driving from Windom. It was after midnight. I had the high beams on as you never meet another car at that time of night. I saw a dark colored upright figure, like a \"big\" man run across the road. The figure was at the edge of my headlights so I didn't get a real clear look at it. It ran from the west to the east. I was traveling pretty fast so I reached where it had crossed within a second or two and it was gone. It had disappeared into a cluster of cedar trees that were along the fence line. I have only told a couple of people about it. At the time I didn't think about it being a big foot because I have never heard of any in the area. After reading other reports recently, I am convinced of what I saw. I did not go back to check. I don't even like to drive that road at night anymore.",
