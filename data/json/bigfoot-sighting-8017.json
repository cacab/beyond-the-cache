  "observed": "My Mother, Father and I were on a family drive in the fall of 1986 or 1987. I'm still not to for sure which year, but I know it happened in Vinton County, Ohio. We were on a road called Experimental Forest Road just east of Hamden off of State Route 160. This is southeast of Mcarthur and Dundas, Ohio. We were driving along when a very tall, large, fast moving creature ran across the road in front of us. It was being chased by a pack (three to four) of dogs. The creature looked as though it would stand, eight to nine feet tall and at weighed at least 300 pounds if not more. It ran straight up like a man, but it was way to fast to be a person and much to large. It looked like a brown blur. It was covered in long, dirty brown hair. As it made its way across the road, down over the hill, it a made a very loud, low pitched howl that could not be made by a man. It was so loud that it echoed. My dad thought about stopping since he had his 30.06 rifle on the window rack in the pickup but my mom told him to keep driving.",
