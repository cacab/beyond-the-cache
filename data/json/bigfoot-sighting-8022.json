  "observed": "I, my wife and 2 sons were living on a remote farm in Hawkins Co TN. One nite around 11 PM directly behind the house screaming started. It was like the combination  of a woman, large cat and a mule. It took place in a cedar thicket up on a hill. I ran outside on the porch to see what was going on. I could also here the sound of trees cracking or thrashing The screaming kept up for approximatly 1 1/2 hrs. The house itself sat on a bench, surrounded by ridges or in a bowl so to speak. What ever was making the screams and growls , did so while circling the house on the ridges. After standing on the porch for a few minutes {the whole time my wife was begging me to comeback in) I went back in the house. Alls I had was a single shot 20ga shotgun., which I loaded. We both sat there scared to death. We had no phone and the nearest neighbor lived a 1/2 mi away down a 4 wheel drive road which was treacherous in daylight. ",
