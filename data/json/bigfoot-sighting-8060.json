  "observed": "It was a Saturday morning in August, a friend and I were going hunting.  We were driving down Lanes Ferry Hwy about 5:00am when we came around a curve and some thing ran across the road in front of us in the headlights. I looked at my buddy and said \"did you see that?\" and he said \"Yes, what was it?\"  I said it looked like a baby bigfoot. He said that's what he thought also but wanted to make sure i did too. He was about 4 or 5 ft tall and you could see his arms swinging when he ran ran across the road from one cow pasture to the other headed towards the bluff and the river in the same direction as where we were going to hunt.",
