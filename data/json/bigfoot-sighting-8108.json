  "observed": "I saw something very tall and dark cross the road ahead of my car. It was about 7 or 8 feet tall because it was taller than the sign there at the bridge, at least head and shoulders taller. I was heading to Marshall, and I saw movement on the side of the road. I slowed cause I thought it might be a deer. I was about 100 yards away when it stepped up on the road. It crossed the highway in three strides and went in to the bush as I passed by. It was almost dark and I couldn't see too well, but I did stop there just past the second bridge heading east. I got out and looked but it was gone. There was a trail where the water had dripped off it though: it was kind of flooded there I guess it was crossing the water through the woods there. There was a foul smell like a dead animal but i didn't see any there by the road. I stood there for about a minute I guess, i didn't see anything else but I did feel like it was there in the brush looking at me though. I got in my car and left.",
