  "observed": "My son and I were going north on FM 1997 outside of Marshall, Texas heading to Lake O' the Pines for New Year's party. We saw something that appeared to be a very large man with a brown fur coat on. It was a mostly wooded area but the thing was just off the road approximately 8 feet. The highway right-of-way was cleared about 20 feet to wooded areas on both sides. A small creek ran a few feet north of where it (the creature or ?) was. It looked like it was kneeling possibly on one knee facing away from us. I slowed the car when we first saw it. We said to each other \"what was that?\" We discussed going back to get a better look but decided against it. The next morning we went back to the spot to see if maybe someone had left a large object on the side of the road, but found nothing.",
