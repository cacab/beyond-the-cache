  "observed": "No, this was not a visual sighting, I only heard this....  It happened a few years ago, when I was camping in a remote area around Yosemite National Park.  It was very late, my friends had already went to thier tents to sleep.  They were Dome-type tents, and mine was about 40 or 50 yards away from the others. Anyway, I had just turned off my radio (with headphones), and was drifting off to sleep, when I heard these heavy-sounding footsteps moving around my tent.  Talk about being petrified, because I sure was!!  I have lived around farm animals for most of my life and I know about what size this creature was, by just the sound.  It was bigger than a bear; besides bears can't walk on thier rear-legs for that long.",
