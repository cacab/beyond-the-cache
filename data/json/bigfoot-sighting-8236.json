  "observed": "I was driving north down Brownsville Road towards State Route 16 with a girlfriend. We were both cheerleaders and were heading to Licking Valley High School for a game. We were driving fast down the road coming up to the Claylick area. As we approached the area we saw something very hairy and very large squatting in the middle of the road. Since the road was very narrow, I decided to drive towards it so I wouldn't go off the road into the creek. At a distance of ten feet away, I waited for an impact but surprisingly nothing happened. Apparently it jumped out of the way or maybe even rolled out of the way. When I looked in my rear view mirror, it was gone. I have know idea where it went and didn't stop to see. When we finally drove about a ¼ mile down the road, we finally spoke to each other. My friend and I tried to decide if that was a dog, a bear, etc… but nothing met the description. Judging by what I saw of the animal, it was baboon like in appearance but much larger in size.",
