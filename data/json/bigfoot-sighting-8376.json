  "observed": "I was hunting hogs and felt I was being watched all day. I turned around to go back to the truck. It was sitting beside a tree. It stood up and I looked at it through a scope. It walked away like I was not even there. [It was] big, very big. The hair on it was dark brown, close to a chestnut horse. The hair was long and matted. The face had no hair on it. It looked almost soft. It eyes were big and brown, very soft and thoughtful like it was working things out. I wished I could draw to show what I mean.",
