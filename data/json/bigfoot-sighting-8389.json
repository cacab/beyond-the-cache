  "observed": "I'm only 12 years old.  I was siting on the couch when I was waiting for my dad to come home when I saw a black figure running down the street.  It was about 11:30 at night when I saw it.  I thought it was a germiln or a baby bigfoot.  I didn't want to see it up close because I was too scared.  It was maybe about 3 to 4 feet tall and it was runing with long arms swaying back and forth.  Also it ran like the hunch back of Notre Dame.   Then I ran up stairs until my dad got home.",
