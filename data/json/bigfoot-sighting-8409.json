  "observed": "In May of 1983 (during the first week of May of that year), while camping in the Santa Fe National Forest in northern New Mexico, I experienced a most peculiar visitation. I was 30 years old at the time and a trade school student in Albuquerque (machine drafting). I was part of a student group from the Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque. We were camping fairly high up in the mountains / hills on an alcohol-free student activity prior to the end of the school year.  Our student advisor was a Mr. Ray Paytiamo from the Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico. Early that morning, at around four a.m., I was asleep in my own tent (alone) when I was actually awakened by an awful stench.  This foul odor was so powerful, the \"scent\" actually burnt my nostrils.  I sat up in my sleeping bag just in time to see a massive light-brown hairy arm reach into the tent through the front flap and start to \"feel around.\" Totally horrified, I started to hyperventilate, as this huge arm clearly was not human.  Just as I was about to scream my lungs out, the arm drew back and out of the tent. I was strangely aware then that there were two \"creatures\" right outside of my tent as I heard two separate and distinct \"vocalizations\" -one male and one female.  Through the dim outside light (and through the tent material), I could make out at least two figures possibly eight feet in height. The next thing I heard were these two beings \"yelling\" loudly as they apparently ran away from my tent. I stayed awake until sunrise and was so enthralled by what had happened that I could not bring myself to tell anyone about this event (and at breakfast, no one else there was talking about any similar occurrence). I have never told anyone about this until earlier this year**. **I reported this same event to another web site (in greater detail) several weeks ago and there was no comment from whoever maintains that particular site.  Thus, I have provided this site with only a short version as I do not know how this account will be welcomed.",
