  "observed": "I was on my way to work just before day light, it was starting to get light, when I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye across an over grown farm field. I hit my brakes to get a better look thinking it might be a deer. What I saw was about 7 feet tall weighing about 300 to 350lbs running on two legs fast. It was not light enough to get a better look. I came to a stop to watch it run into the woods, I was about 75 feet from where it disappeared.  I tried to see where it was going to come out at but never got a second look.",
