  "observed": "it.started about june of 1997 with a loud wistleing at night.i kept trying to figure out what kind of bird or animal was i have never heard anythang like this before.shortly after i started hearing the noises at night i found some strange feces at the edge of the woods about 100 yds or so from my house .i have never seen any like it before. it looked sort of human but i could tell what ever it was it had ben eating leaves and grass. idont remember quite but it was about aug or sept the whistleing stoped.i figured what ever it was had gone. in oct two of my brothers came over and we went squirrel hunting.on the way back to the house we walked close to the area where i saw the feces. one of my went one way and me and my brother made circle came back around and met our other brother.when we got back around to where he was he came running up to us all excited saying did you see that did you see that i said no i didnt see anything. he said it must have ran rite by you. i ask him again. what did he see. he said i dont know it was gray and ijust saw back of this thing. he said it didnt a deer or dog or any animal. after that i didnt think much.but about 1 month later i dont remember the date but it was november 3;oo in the afternoon i looked out the upstairs of my house and mabey a little over 100yds away at about the spot where i saw the feces i saw these two cretures they were gray. they were standing side by side sort of swaying back and forth.i watched for about 10 sec. and then i done someing i souldnt have done i ran down stairs as fast as i could to try and get a better look. when i got out the back door they were gone. its hard to say how tall they were mabey 5 ft mabey 6 ft. they were taller than any 4 legged wild animals that lives around here.that was the last i have or heard from these things. some time after it was all over i remembered something that happened before all this started. i am not sure but i thank it was in the spring of 97 just through the woods a short ways from where the feces was there was an old barbed wire fince. in the top strand of this about 4 ft off the ground was some long gray hair. it was about 4 mabey 5 in of hair on each side of the barb. and i remember thinking at the time what kind of animal around here has hair like this. 1997",
