  "observed": "At the base of the mountain the road crews had huge gravel piles that they were using in building this new road. I was looking up the mountain to see if I could spot Bighorn sheep as we had seen Grizzley and many other of the Yellowstone animals while driving the loop of the park. I immediately noticed at on the side of the mountain nearst the top a large triangular patch of snow and walking in large strides a tall 8-9 foot hairy upright Bigfoot-like animal. It was so tall that you couldnt help but not see it. Then it made three strides across this rocky terrain and stopped just above a green grassy like area next to the snow. My son saw the same sight as I because he was excited saying that it looked like and walked like Chewbaca the Star Wars actor.Even though it was so high above us you could make out what it was. Im only sorry that we couldnt stop and pull off but the traffic was fast and no where to pull off because of the road crews.",
