I listened for a while and tried to figure out what could make such a loud, repetitive noise.  It wasn't a coyote howl or fishercat screach, didn't sound like any owl I know of, wasn't a raccoon or tree rodent...  After 15 - 20 minutes, I went to sleep. My dog woke me with frightened barking at 4:00 AM when the sound was twice as loud and I knew the critter was within 100 feet of the house.  Also, there were two responding calls, one sounded fairly close and one was in the distance.  I got up to make sure the sheep were OK in their pasture with an electric fence around it and there was nothing by the barn where the goats were.  I flashed the light over to the chicken coop and nothing was there either.  I flashed the light throughout the yard and into the trees to see if there was any clue or any danger to the animals.  I saw nothing and while I shone the light, the calls ceased. All day I asked EVERYONE if they knew of any local animal that made the noise and repeated it all day long.  A friend suggested that I look it up on the internet.  I listened to all sorts of animal vocalizations with no luck.  When I finally typed in the words of the actual sound it was an identical match to this site!!!  I'm not saying I had a bigfoot encounter, but I definately encountered whatever the campers up in Lincoln, NH encountered last summer!!!  There may be a rational explaination and someone may know of an indigenous animal that makes that sound -- and trust that I will still try to find out what it is... but the sound will resonate in my memory -- as it was like no other animal/bird I've ever heard.  It was not too fast, nor garbled, it was incredibly loud and clear.  The dog was very nervous.",
