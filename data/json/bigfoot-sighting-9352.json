  "observed": "Date: 09/19/2004 Time: Approx. 6:00 PM Conditions: Partly Cloudy w/ clear visibility Location: About one mile or less from Cascade Summit Pass on Hwy 138. I had spent the weekend visiting my kids in Ashland and was returning home to Redmond. I was traveling on a very straight section of 138 East of the pass when I saw a large very dark humanoid figure appear out of the woods and very quickly run (great strides) across the roadway and disappear into the woods to the south before I could get even to it. It was maybe 50 yards ahead at first sight. Though it was clear, it appeared to be shadowed from head to foot.",
