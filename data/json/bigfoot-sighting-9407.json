One morning after the creek had frozen back hard after partly thawing my sister and i went to play on the ice. When we arived we noticed that what apeared to be a small bare footed child had walked across the ice before it had fully frozen. The track had a definite form a heel, front pad and five toes .It had crossed a distance of about twenty feet in six steps went up a steep bank slipped down and went on up the bank. No other prints were ever seen and i have never heard of any other encounters in that area. The print was about eight inchs long and three or four inches wide.",
