  "observed": "I was with several of my friends and we were lighting off fireworks (the bright kind, not the loud kind) in an abandoned gravel pit we had walked to a few miles down the road.  We were getting ready to light one off when we all heard a loud scream.  It was very early in the morning, probably around 1:00 a.m., and it was loud enough and so uot of place that it made all of us pause.  It sounded identical to the Klamath Screams I heard on the Oregon Bigfoot website.  It wasn't right next to us, it was some distance away, but it was loud.  Though we were all creeped out, we just brushed it off at the moment.  Later, I remembered your website and that Bigfoot/Sasquatches have been known to vocalize similar screams.",
