  "observed": "This happened in Vilas county when i was hunting during the bow season.  I was near Trout lake or i call it Trout Springs. Anyways i woke up that morning at about 4 in the morning and i hopped in the truck and drove there.  I got to the place and it had been really windy before i left and when i go tout of the car it was silent.  It was kind of Erie.  So i got out.  Then i thought i heard something, i didn't think anything of it because there are alot of animals walking around.  Then the steps began to get louder. I thought maybe it was a buck chasing a doe becauseit was the rut.  But then i Heard a loud groooooo groooooo grooooo.I just froze. Then i hopped in the truck and got the hell out of there. I talked to a guy later that day and told him the story.  He told me that it might be a Bigfoot.",
