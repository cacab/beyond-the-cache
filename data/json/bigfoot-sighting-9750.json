  "observed": "I have always wanted to tell this story to someone and after reading report #1939 I finally have the nerve to tell it. I live in Carteret county and at the time worked in Sneads Ferry (Onslow County) and the commute to work everyday took me through camp LeJeune via the back gate. As I made the turn onto Hwy. 17 off of Hwy. 172 I noticed what I thought was a bear sitting  down under a huge pecan tree on the right. Since there was about 50 or 60 feet distance between me & \"the bear\" I decided to pull of to the side of the road & watch him for a minute. It was a warm July morning & I had the windows of my truck rolled down as usual and noticed the most ungodly smell I had ever experienced. It was kinda like rotten eggs mixed with sewage & sulfur. As I sat & watched I quickly realized that this was no bear as the creature stood up from the croutched position walked over to the pecan tree & began shaking it. I was floored by what I was watching. Understand that this tree is immense & the creature had no problem shaking the pecans from it. Pecans that are still in the green hulls by the way. I wanted a better look at it since the whole sighting was with it's back to me so I put the truck in 1st gear (ready to bug out if need be)  & blowed the horn. It suddenly stopped & just completely froze still with it's back to me. it stayed like that til I layed down on the horn about 10 seconds later & it slowly turned & looked right at me. Thats when my heart decided to do the 50 yard dash in 2.3 seconds. I couldn't see it's face that well but it stood about 8 - 10 ft. Tall & it's hair was very long & matty. It stared at me for what seemed an eternity & made a loud screaching noise & tore off into the woods. The sprint from the tree to the woods was about 30 yards or so & it took him no time to reach them. I'm talking split seconds! On my way home that day I decided to stop again and though the creature was gone I could still smell that ungodly mix of stinch. To this day when I pass by that pecan tree my heart races.",
