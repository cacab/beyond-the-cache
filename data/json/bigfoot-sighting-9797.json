  "observed": "I was in Oregon up in the mountains at the Cornucopia Ghost Town. My older brother and I were messing around in the creek below the ghost town and we looked up to see bigfoot running up the creek. We were a little scared at seeing what looked to be a very hairy human running up past us. It just not really looked like a human face - it was different. He kind of looked like a monkey with a human body. My brother and I ran up to where our family was having a BBQ and they ran down just to see him running into the trees. Since that day I have been very interested in this mysterious creature that has left an image in my head.",
