  "observed": "While doing some early season scouting for deer season in a remote part of West Branch State Park, I noticed a set of strange tracks that looked very fresh.  At first they looked human, but I thought it was odd a person would be walking barefoot it some of the nastiest deepest and thick mud slop around.  The inlet along the shores of a lake was covered with pricker bush and briars.  I followed the tracks for about 400 yards until they cut through a mud swamp.  A person would have taken the easy dry trail, these tracks went through the mud swamp.  I tried to step through the swamp but sunk over my boots.  Thats when I really looked hard at the tracks.  They were not outrageously long, I say about size 10 but the were very narrow and they sunk alot deeper in the mud than my 200 lb frame did.  The toes were very strange and appeared to be much longer than a humans, the left foot looked like it had suffered an injury to two of the interior toes.  The stride was long and I had to strech to walk the same path.  I'm six foot tall.  I circled around the swamp a caught the tracks on the other side of the swamp inlet and followed them for another 300 yards until I lost them back on dry ground where they went into the forest.",
