  "observed": "Just wanted to acknowlege that myself & my sister sighted a bigfoot, or what looked like one in the 60s in East Texas at my grandparents home in the Piney woods. It was in the summer and we could see out the bedroom window. There was a full moon and we heard something step on branches or twigs. We looked out the window and saw a big, hairy animal and my grandfather knocked the screen out of the window and shot. The animal bellowed or roared. About that time we heard him running and saw him clear the barb wire fence that separated the pasture from the area around the house. He cleared that fence, just practically stepped over it and there was a creek on down the pasture area, Boggy Creek, it was a spring creek with lots of pine and cedar trees. We had a lynx or bobcat on that creek, too. This animal had lots of hair and looked somewhat like an ape but was walking tall and upright, he had his back turned to us, we were simply looking out my bedroom window at the creature, but he was huge, around 7 foot tall I would say and I had 20-20 vision at that time. I was a teenager and my sister, Mary, was 4 years younger. I don't remember my exact age or hers, or the year, either, but definitely remember the incident. This happened at Bradfield Chapel in Daingerfield, Texas.",
