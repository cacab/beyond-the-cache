  "observed": "We were driving back from Creasant Beach that night. It was a foggy night around 2am. My friend was driving when he had to swerve to miss this thing standing in the lane we were in. It was standing about 3 feet in the road on the west bound lane. My friend was so scared he would not go back. We got a good look at it. It looked about 6'6\" to 7' tall, long arms, very hairy, resembled a man more then an animal. It had on dirty torn clothes, and around 270 or more pounds. The thing looked like it could pick up the car. The face looked like a male,standing relaxed with shoulders dropped. It looked savage looking like a cave man type face. My buddy was scared and wouldn't turn around, I was kind of scared but wanted to see it again but he was driving his car and wouldn't stop. We were driving through a place called Putnam Hall on SR100 west bound. 2-10 miles past church.",
