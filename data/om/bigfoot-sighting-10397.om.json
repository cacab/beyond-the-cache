  "observed": "Submitted on behalf of the witnesses, husband and wife, with their permission. This was the couple's first summer in WA and they had out of state guests. They wanted to show them NW wilderness and took them to Hannon Lake which was difficult to get to on a beat up logging road. The couple, a brother, and cousin rowed around the lake together in a boat while others remained on shore. The boat passed in view of a cove while still in site of the shore party. A creature was standing in knee deep water in the back of the cove facing outward but bent over splashing water on its chest the way a person tests the temperaure before getting in. Someone said \"WHAT IS THAT?\" Altogether the boaters looked to shore and the creature straightened and looked directly at them. Without hesitation or hurry it turned and walked out of the lake and into the woods. The boaters rowed over to the shore intending to see what might be found. They abandoned the effort when the boat got into murky, weed choked water. The shore was covered by dense trees and was creepy under the circumstances. The sighting distance was about 100 yds. The creature is described as having a uniform length of thick auburn-brown hair all over except for the mouth and eyes. It was 7+ ft. in height with a massive, muscular bulk and proportional build. S. had the impression it was male due to its thick coat, no genitalia were seen. The head was oval, possibly peaked.",
