  "observed": "It was early one morning, probally around 6:00 am, and i was up and decided to go into the kitchen and wash dished from the night before while my children were asleep.  We were renting a house right off hwy 100 in Hickman County.  It was an older farm house and had several acers of fenced in land back behind it.  About half way in the middle of this field behind the house, it was crossed fenced from one tree line across to another tree line.  So, after I had finished the dishes I walked over to the back window in the kitchen.  I looked out and right past where the feild was cross fenced, I saw something walking.  I took a second look because I could not beliece what I had just seen.  It was a very large creature walking as if it were in a big hurry to cross the field to get to the trees on the opposite side.  It was tall enough that I could see down to it's legs over the fence.  It was a tan color with places that were darker as if it were wet or muddy.  It's hair was long on it's arms and on it's face.  I could only really see it's eyes and nose for the hair.  when it passed a break in the fence, I could see that it's legs were also covered in long hair. I watched it until it disappeared into the trees on the other side of the field.  I had even ran from the kitchen window into the bedroom window to watch it.  I never went down to look for tracks that it might have left because I was too scared.  And I also never told anyone for a long time because they might think that I was crazy.  They still to this day think that I am crazy but I believe what I saw was the real thing.  I believe I saw bigfoot.  And I will always say that I did.",
