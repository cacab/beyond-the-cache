  "observed": "(Report as stated in telephone interview with investigator)When I was thirteen years of age a friend and I were riding our bicycles on a country road near some abandoned railroad tracks. We were startled to hear a maple tree come crashing to the ground. My friend immediately left on his bicycle. The tree was about two inches in diamater.  Looking up I was amazed to see a very tall large animal standing next to the tree.  It was about seven and one half feet tall and very hairy. I would guess it weighed about four hundred fifty pounds. I was about ninety feet from it.  I froze in disbelief and we stared at each other for at least two minutes. It then slowly started walking towards me and I panicked.  I turned my bicycle around and road home as fast as I could go. ",
