  "observed": "First of all I have kept this to myself for many years, for fear that people would say we were nuts. It was early summer late spring my brother and I were test driving his new toyota pickup,  I guess it would be south and east of the millcreek watershed near the wash. oregon boarder.We had just crossed millcreek and passed the watershed entrance about a mile or so up the hill.The road was gravel and one side was steep embankment down into the gorg and the other went straight up.We had stopped to take a leak on the side of the road. As I stand there I looked across the gorg, it was approx. 100 yds. and there on an old tree stump was this thing, just standing there motionless looking at us. It was about 2:30 or so in the afternoon clear sunny day  about 75 degrees. I quickly turned to my brother who was standing at the other end of the truck and told him to look up on the hill. We both stood there looking at this thing look at us for a good 5 min. or so. then as if it were never there it turned and disappeared into the trees. It looked like a large hairy man kinda brownish with dark streaks and patches on the shoulders and hips and legs.It moved so quickly , it was there one second gone the next. I do not recall any significant smells but it was big what ever it was.We could not get to the area where it was standing do to the terrain so we could not see if there were any tracks. But if they are out there that area above walla walla is where they are.",
