  "observed": "At approximately 10:00 PM on a Saturday night. I was on my way to Chippewa Lake to pick up my sister in law, I was traveling South on River Styx Rd. between Route 18 and Route 162 when I noticed a deer crossing sign and thought I better slow down before a deer jumps out in front of me. Seconds later, I saw eyes just off the road reflecting from my headlights and I thought it would be a deer so I slowed down to a crawl so I would not hit it if it decided to cross the road. But as I got closer, I noticed that the eyes were to high off the ground to be a deer and when I took a closer look I saw a (7 or 8 ft.) tall man-like creature next to a big tree. He was noticeably hairy and had very long arms, like down to his knees. He looked right at me as I passed like he was waiting to cross the road. I could not believe what I had just saw and I could not bring myself to turn around for a second look. I never did report this to anyone except for friends and family, until my son showed me this sight and I read other people's stories.",
