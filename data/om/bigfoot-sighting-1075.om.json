  "observed": "Witness, 38, who requested confidentiality, was a young teen in junior high school at time of the incident. Witness, who will be called Jeff, said he and his friend were alone at his parents house one night when the friend, since deceased,  noticed \"something\" looking into the house through the front door. Since the friend was \"always a kidder,\" Jeff just looked outside to call his friend's bluff. \"But sure enough, there was this head looking at us.'' He said since it was dark, few details were visible, but he described it as \"like a coconut.'' \"We freaked out, so we ran into mom's bedroom and grabbed the .22 and loaded it with bullets. I told (the friend) to go lock the door, but he said no way. So we ran into the bedroom, which at the time didn't have curtains. Soon we heard it breathing and kind of scratching at the window and we saw a hand up against the screen. I would say it had to be 8 to 10 feet tall to be looking in like that.'' Witness stated at that time, he could see the animal looking in the window. He described it as \"large, hairy and black.'' \"My friend fired two shots at it, but missed. It took off running and we didn't see it after that.'' The two called the sheriff, who came to investigate and found the two bullet holes in the window, but no blood and no footprints on the hard adobe ground. The sheriff asked if the two had been drinking, but both were aspiring wrestlers. Jeff said neither of them drank nor used drugs. Jeff's brother, who initially contacted the BFRO, said that when he and his parents came home, his brother and friend appeared to be \"scared to death.'' The brother also said the impression of a large hand could be seen in the window screen.",
