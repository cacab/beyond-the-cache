  "observed": "When I was around 10, 11 or 12 (1975-77) Sorry, I don't remember exactly -- it's been a while. When I was a kid, My grandparents had a little bitty camper at a campsite at Nolin Lake. I couldn't tell you precisely where it was either. If I had to, I could probably get my father to tell me where it was, but that would mean I'd have to tell him this story ... Anyway ... one summer my father took the family (me, my sister and mother) to my grandparents site for a little vacation. One evening as it was becoming dusk, I remember standing inside the camper looking out the screen door at my father who was cooking at the grill. The campsite sat at the top of a hill in a wooded area. The woods consisted mostly of old growth, deciduous trees, so there weren't really any evergreens or shrub-type trees like cedars which could really block your view. So I was looking out the door at my father who was on my left and eventually, out of boredom I guess, I ended up scanning to the right and down the hill into the woods. I remember seeing about midway down the hill, something that caught my eye. You know how when you think you see something and in a split second your mind says, \"Did I just see what I THOUGHT I saw?\" Well that's what happened to me. There he was. Midway down the hill -- I'm getting chills right now typing this -- partially hidden behind a tree was this \"man thing\" I could see his whole head, his right shoulder and part of his leg coming out from behind the tree. He/it was grayish brown and he was looking right at me (Maybe not -- but it sure felt like he was looking at me) I looked away thinking I had to be imagining it but when I looked back, it was still there and I had no problem picking him out from the trees. At that point my mother who was cooking at the stove behind me said something to me and I turned around to talk to her. When I looked back outside down the hill, he was gone. I kept looking through all the trees, but I couldn't find him. After that I was scared. I didn't leave the camper the rest of the night. I was an avid comic book reader at the time, so I used that as an excuse to stay in. I remember I kept looking out the door that night just to check around and see if he came back and my parents kept asking me to come out and sit by the fire ... I didn't dare tell my parents about what I saw because my father's teasing is legendary in my family. He's the oldest of 7 boys so he REALLY nows how to get under your skin. What I saw was big and burley and it didn't make any sounds that I can remember. It had a big, squarish head (kind of blocky with rounded corners) that looked like it sat right on its shoulders. I really don't recall seeing a neck. I could see a massive shoulder and a thick bicep. I could also see its chunky hip and a good portion of its thigh down to about it's knee. All the rest was hidden behind the tree. From time to time I'll see an animal show that will feature a three toed sloth, and every time I see a sloth I always think, \"That sloth's hair looks like that bigfoot I saw when I was a kid\" If you want, I can draw what I saw if that helps any.",
