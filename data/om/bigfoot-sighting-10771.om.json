  "observed": "I saw what I thought was a bear. Alongside a creek bed at the bottom of a mountain off state forest road 77 in the Cherokee National Forest. About 10 miles down a gravel road past the Chilhowee Campground I stopped to take a break. I smelled a strong musty urine scent. Then I heard a low deep slow grunt not 25 ft. from me. I looked in the direction of the noise and standing behind some underbrush at the creek, I saw a large black and gray thing standing looking right at me! It's not no bear I thought immediatly. It had a rather large roundish head with a lot of gray on it with a very noticable eyebrow and mustache accent. It's nose was large and mostly flat and blackish in color as well as it's lower lip. I remember it having a large square shaped lower jaw. I was very upset as my heart was pounding like a drum as I worked my way back to my car door, it just stared at me. It's eyes I recall is what scared me the most. They were large also and had a bright brown appearance and I never took my eyes off him. I saw how really big this thing was when it turned and disappeared into the thick brush. It's shoulders were massive with a very short neck and more gray hair than black hair on his back that seemed to be about 2-3 in. in length. The whole sighting only lasted for 1-2 minutes and I'm glad, but for me I'm in the know. I know something is out there that only another eyewitness could understand. Only bigfoot or whatever you call him will let you get a glimpse, you just have to be ready!",
