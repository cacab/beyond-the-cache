  "observed": "It was a few years ago on a cold, early winter morning.  There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn't believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn't figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn't believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.",
