  "observed": "It was unusually warm to be mid-December on this day and me and my buddy was hunting in a area known as Chilhowee. It was about a hour before sunset when we climbed out of our deer stands. I met my buddy in a little holler about 100 yards from both of our tree stands. We were walking back to the 4 wheeler when we heard a very low rumble in the holler we had just met in. We were now at this time about 35 yards from the holler almost in a field, so we thought we would be real still and sit on the edge of the field for a minute and see if we could hear anything else. At this time we were thinking it was just a grunt or a blow from a deer that we had scared. We wated probally 10 minutes before we heard a loud splash in a little drinking hole, me and my buddy looked at each other and said what the hell is that. So we wated another minute, still hoping that a deer would come out then we heard a second splash. At this time we realized it wasn’t a deer. so we walked probally 20 yards and saw what we believe is a bigfoot. It was aproximately 7 to 8 feet tall and I would say weighed 300-350 pounds just guessing.  Me and my friend were almost in shock at what we had scene. The bigfoot saw us and actually didn’t seem to care that we were watching it.  He kind of just lingered around the area for another minute before walking over a small ridge where we lost sight of it and to be honest we were to scared to go and look for it so we went back to the house and told everybody there, but they said we were crazy and it was just a bear. I have been hunting bear for years and I am familiar with their movements.  This was no bear.  I know this because it never dropped down on all four of its feet the whole time we watched it and we probally saw it walk a total of only 30-40 yards but I am 100 % sure it was no bear.  It was some sort of human ape creature I am positive it was a sasquatch and so is my buddy.",
