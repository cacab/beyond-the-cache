  "observed": "In late October of 1989, about 4:00 in the afternoon while out hunting in an area that I was very familiar with. I had spent about three hours hunting, and was heading back to my vehicle. While walking threw the bottoms, I had noticed the abscence of the normal aray of usual small animals. When I approached the top of a ravine, where I was starting to enter a field, I heard a loud noise in the brush behind me down the hill. I did not see anything at this point, so I proceeded to continue across the field. When I reached the other side of the field, I again heard a noise from where I had just crossed the field. I crouched down in some brush as to not be seen. As I turned to look back across the field where I heard the noise, I suddenly saw a very large creature crouching also. At first I thought It may have been a bear, I poked my head up just a little bit to get a better view and the creature stood erect. I at that point also stood up. It was obviously looking right at me, as I was staring at it also. It was dark brown in color, standing aprox. six to seven feet tall. I could not see its face in great detail due to the distance, but I could make out a lighter color in the facial area, as to less hair. Its arms hung down to it's side, and it had large thick legs. While I stood there, It also just stood very still. It made a low tone, loud grunt, and waved it's left arm into the air. It then turned back towards the tree line and disappeared back into the woods. At that point I was scared enough to not cross back over the field and pursue, or even try and just see it again. I went straight to my vehicle, and left the area.",
