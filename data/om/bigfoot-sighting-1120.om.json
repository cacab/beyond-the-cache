  "observed": "This is a true story which I remember very well, even though it has been around thirty years since it happened.  I owned three dogs at this time, two hounds and a squirrel dog. They turned up missing for about three days. On the night of that third day I had a wind-up alarm clock set inside of a washpan because I was so hard to wake up. Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m. my wife shook me awake saying the dogs must be back. She heard some growling noise real close to the house. When I heard the noise, I told my wife \"that ain’t no dog\". It was the weirdest growling sound I ever heard. I jumped out of bed so fast I hit the dishpan and it went across the floor and made a lot of racket. I looked out the window through the window screen and there was what must have been a bigfoot creature of some sort. It was not a bear. It was a very moonlit night, so I know I couldn’t mistake a bear for something else. And it was not human! It was covered in long wavy hair on its body, but much less hair around the facial area. It had a humanlike face and yet it wasn’t human. Suddenly it turned its head (not its body) just its head and just stared in my direction. I started to feel a panic coming on, but I knew I had to do something. I raced to get my shotgun, ran out the front door. I was sure I could reach the yard in time. But it was gone, even though there shouldn’t have been time for it to past the clearing of the yard. So I fired the shotgun into the air just in case it was still close by. Less than one day later our dogs returned to us.",
