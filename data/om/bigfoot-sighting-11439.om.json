  "observed": "Recently my son went outside just after dark.  He ran back in telling me there was something out side making a strange noise.  I went outside thinking I was going to hear the nearby bulls, dogs, or even a coyote.   What I heard was the strangest sound I had ever heard.  We stood there for quite a while trying to figure out what it could be until my five year old started crying saying he was scared. Today I listened to several video [audio] clips of the Sasquatch Whoop Howl.  That is the EXACT sound I heard.  I got chills when I heard these recordings. I then looked up sightings in Texas to see if it were possible that there could be any in my area.  I was shocked to discover that there had been sightings very close to my house in Newton County on the Sabine River.  I even found where there had been a sighting in Buna, which is where I live, in the 1980's.  I live in a wooded area.  The woods behind me, over 500 acres, have been untouched for over a hundred years.  It has just recently been sold and timber starting to be cut in the area.  I am wondering if this is stirring it up?  Please let me know if you think it could be possible that what I heard is real.  I know that is the sound I heard.  I will be listening now every night and hope to get a recording.  Also, my children play in the woods quite often. Is there any danger for them playing in the woods?",
