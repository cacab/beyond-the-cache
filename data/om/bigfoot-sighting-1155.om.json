  "observed": "A man on a motorcycle turned off of 27th street onto Fairfield Street. just in front of the Lincoln Electric Co. He said a bigfoot like creature ran in front of him causing him to fall, the creature proceeded south towards Salt Creek about half a block. This area at the time was very isolated. Now there are buildings everywhere and the city limits have been moved back considerably. It was in the papers the next day we lived about half a mile up Fairfield St. I remember not wanting to go outside in the neighborhood at night for awhile. The kids were still young so it must have been between 15-18 years ago. At the time of the sighting there was mostly farmland. The guy was so scared he continued on his way, after he got up from the fall he also said it just smelled terrible. Anyway that's what the Lincoln Journal and Star reported the next day. I must tell you the New Lincoln Electric System bldg was new and out in the middle of nowhere. Just a few new houses were scattered west and northwest of the building",
