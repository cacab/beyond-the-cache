  "observed": "I was riding my motorcyle north on Rt 165 having just passed the John Deere dealership. This particular section of road is straight for more then a mile. I was about a quarter of the way into this mile-long stretch when I saw a large dark 2-legged \"thing\" come out of the woods on the right side of the road. I initially thought that it was a person, except that it crossed the road in 6 steps. This road is a single lane in both directions with a shoulder on each side capable of getting a broken down vehicle completely off the road. It disappeared into the woods on the other side of the road. It was walking and there was no other traffic on the road at the time.",
