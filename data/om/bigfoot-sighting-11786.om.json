  "observed": "My friend James and I were fishing in one of his dad's ponds. We were frustrated that nothing was biting and had finally moved to the last of about 7 ponds. We had been there for about half an hour when we started hearing a whoop whoop sound and then some lound knocking like two tree trunks being banged together. We both made comments about what it might be but thought much of it. While I was browsing your site I found the recordings. I listened to the whoop and knock on that one recording and almost fell out of my chair. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HEARD!!! The whoop and the knocks were identical to those sounds we heard just above and behind us. It was that far from us but there was a hill that kept us from seeing anything. It was completely wooded in the area the sound came from.",
