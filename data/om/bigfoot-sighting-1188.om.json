  "observed": "my sister and i were driving to school one morning a few years ago and straight up ahead we both saw something standing there in the road on two feet for sure, staring at us approaching. As we approached we could tell that the creature was about the size of a human, was covered with very dark, shaggy hair, and it was sorta hunched over with it's arms hanging down quite far. it just stood there about a foot ot two into the road watching us and then almost as qucikly as it had happened, it vanished into the trees. when we drove by i looked into the forest to see if i saw anything, but couldn't see anything. we went to school and told a few friends and then told out parents later that night. we didn't think to call the police or anything at the time, although i wish we had. when we tell people they never believe us because most people don't believe in \"bigfoot\". i'm glad that this sight is here so that someone might finally believe us. i know what we saw was real and i know that it wasn't a bear. bears are not shapped like humans and very rarley walk around on two feet",
