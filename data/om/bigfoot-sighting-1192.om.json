  "observed": " Many years ago I lived up in Coos county in New Hampshire. Some of the old men would talk about things called \"wood devils\" that live in the woods. There aparently were alot more of these creatures back in the 1930's than there are now. These Wood Devils were tall and very skinny. They are grey colored and very hairy. I guess that people saw them mostly when they didnt expect to. They stay in the deep woods. They can run very fast. When a person walked through the woods he would nearly walk into one before he spotted it. They hide by standing upright and still aginst a tree. As a person aproaches it it will stand against the opposite side of the tree. As the person passes it will move so that the tree is always between the person and the tree. If it cannot hide it will still stay perfectly still until it knows the person sees it. They make awful screams. They have a semi human shape, but their faces dont look at all human. I have never seen one, but the people who said they did were regular church goers and would strap their kids for lying. I dont think they would carry on discussions of things they made up.",
