  "observed": "About 11 years ago, my fiance and I had a cabin on Mt. Hood in Oregon state. We were in the roofing business and I was sorting out some cedar shakes outside the cabin. I had my Rottweiler tied to a tree. She started growling and looking towards the forest. I looked up and saw something big and hairy step from tree to tree. They have huge cedars in there. It did not register at first what I was seeing, so I yelled for whatever was in there to leave or I would turn the dog loose. It stepped behind another tree and kept doing so repeatedly. I finally called my kids and told them to come out and keep an eye on this thing while I got my work done. (I usually have a Mossberger seni-auto matic shotgun - I did not this day). It was moving in closer and then my boyfriend pulled up and it was gone. It was then that I realized it wasn't a bear we were watching.",
