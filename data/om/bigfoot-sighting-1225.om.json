  "observed": "As I was driving alone in my car I saw a very large dingy white, furry individual cross the road approximately 50 yards in front of my car. He did not appear to notice my car as he did not turn or glance in my direction. This creature took very wide strides and crossed the road quickly although he did not appear to be in a hurry. The creature looked very tall and large to me. I looked around for some way to compare his height and discovered that I could see his head above a \"curving road\" warning sign. This struck me because the creature was at least 5 to 10 yards the other side of the sign from me and I could see his head and shoulders above the sign. He walked upright, but slightly hunched at the shoulders and knees slightly bent. His arms and hands hung down palms to the back. His arms did not swing much as he strode across the hiway. I did not see his face because he did not turn toward me so I don't know if he had a hairy face or not. His head and shoulders and whole body was covered with matted, whitish long hair. The shoulders didn't seem proportioned to the rest of the body. They looked more narrow and the head was not proportionately large either. I saw no shape that would indicate breasts. The hips, waist and thighs seemed bulkey and large proportionately.",
