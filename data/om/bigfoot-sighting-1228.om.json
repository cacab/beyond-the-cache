  "observed": "This incident occurred after my husband, myself and our 3 children and I had moved up to some land purchased on Sugar Loaf mountain west of Boulder. My husband managed a tavern at the time and had purchased the five-acre silver mining claim for a song from (name withheld) at the bar and on a paper napkin. We built a tiny 12 x 16' cabin and squeezed ourselves in there on the south side of the mountain about 2/3 of the way along the original little mining road. The cabin was on only level land on a heavily treed and rocked parcel. The north side of the cabin snugged right up against the mountain slope with pine trees all around. That side was two plywood sections high, which would have put it a hair over 16'. We had an over-sized plywood platform \"bunk-bed\" in the NE corner of the cabin with we adults and our baby daughter on the first level and the two boys on the upper level. We put in a little window up there for them for air and put an inside shutter on it so they could close it when it got really cold, which it sometimes did. It reached 40 below the first winter we were there. I think it was during the second  autumn there, so it would have been 1971, our then 5 1/2 yr old son claimed he heard the sound of footsteps in the early evening after hearing a really strange sound - definitely animal, but he had no words at that age to describe it. He said it sounded like a call of some sort and \"bigger\" than an owl (some kind of hooting???). Then he heard some noises close by - rustlings, etc. When he looked up through the open shutter window  - he said he looked right into the face of a \"monster.\" All I know for sure is that I'll certainly never forget his terrified screams! When he calmed down, he described it as dark and very hairy and a \"funny\" face and glowing eyes; it turned and ran away as soon as he started screaming. His brother, two years older, slept through the incident until his brother's shrieks woke us all. With the ground sharply slanted up, we figured something would have had to have been just about 7-8' tall to peer into that upper window. Not being trained trackers, we found no evidence the next day, but our son, who is now almost 35, swears to this day, that it was Bigfoot that he saw. And I have always believed him since there was no way in the world that, at his age, he could have made up that precise an auditory and visual image or his terror. He came over and visited us this morning. I told him about the article in the Post and he reiterated his story. He says the image has never left him and probably never will.",
