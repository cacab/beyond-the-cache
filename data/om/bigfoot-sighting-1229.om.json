  "observed": "This incident occurred in the fall of the year, in Tulare county, Ca. The year was approximately 1955, plus or minus one year. I was about eleven years old, and on a boy scout camping trip. Although this happened to me a long time back, I now can remember it clearly. I say now because for along time I blocked it out of my mind. Sometime in the early morning hours I left the tent to visit the latrine, which was maybe fifty yards away at the edge of a small ravine. As I was standing there relieving myself I began to hear small limbs and heavy brush breaking just on the other side of the ravine. My first thought was that a steer or cow was over there, and I quickly directed my flashlight beam in the direction of the sounds. What I saw Froze me in terror. It looked to be about seven maybe eight feet tall, covered with long shaggy brown hair and kind of teetering back and forth on it's two feet. The head was very large with no neck to be seen, and the eyes about ten to twelve inches apart,with round glowing orange appearance. The arms were very long, and hung straight down. I turned and ran back to the tent, wetting myself all the way. Everyone that I tried to relate this incident to just laughed at me, including my own family. Finally I just told myself that it didn't really happen. Thats how I left it untill one day a few years ago I picked up \"The Bigfoot Case History Book\", and while paging through it, suddenly there was the picture of what I saw so many years ago. Not ape like at all, but what they referr to as the diving helmet type.",
