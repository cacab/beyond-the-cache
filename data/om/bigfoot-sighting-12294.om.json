  "observed": "My husband was a teacher and had left for school.  Our daughter had just gotten on the grade school bus so it was after 8:00.  There had been no water so I took the two little boys 3 1/2 and 20 months and walked up the hill to clean the screen to the intake on the holding tank. This was taxing because I was 8 months pragnant at the time.  We had just gotten to the top and I was going to sit on a big tree stump.  The cat had jumped on it and immediatly arched her back hair on end and screeched.  I looked to see what she was looking at and there was this huge man like thing... It's hair was long like a horses mane and 'flowed'. It was all black that I could see. It first dropped down, and then got right up and ran uphill, zig zagging around branches as it went. I grabbed the two boys and ran down that hill so fast.  I could have gone a mile. My heart was really pumping.",
