  "observed": "This is just a report from a native that said he saw a hairy person about 6 to 7 feet tall, all hairy, casually walking across the dirt road by Skilak Lake. It looked at him and stopped on the road and appeared surprised. Then it took off into the woods swiftly. He said it was very agile and quick. He was about 275 to 300 yards away. There was no snow on the ground yet. He said they looked at each other for a bit and he loaded his single shot shotgun cause he didn't know if it was friendly or not. He was going to run and tell the authorities but he didn't saying that they wouldn't believe him. He was very serious as he was telling the story. I know the man, he is a strong Christian. That was probably about late October or early November. This place is near Sterling, Alaska. The location is full of spruce forest. I've been in there, it's secluded from the main highway and full of forest and lakes and mountains.",
