  "observed": "In late summer of 1987 my friend and i were riding our bicycles down an old mine road sw of town. The road went down to a creek.We went down to the creek and on our way back, we pushed our bikes back up the road because it was steep.The road goes up along side a canyon,and was old asphalt turned light gray and crumbling.We were maybe a third of the way back up.It was quiet ,then suddenly a crashing breaking sound came from across the canyon.There was something running like a man,covered in dark hair, face humanoid ,right towards us, down the other side of the canyon.It was breaking small trees about 1 to 2 1/2 inches in dia. on its way down like they were made of balsa wood. We both saw this at the same time.It was making a bee line towards us.It scared the hell out of us and we ran as fast as we could trying to bike up the hill but it was faster running in the end, until we got nearer the top.There was no way it was a bear.It was clearly running like a man and the head was small like a man, with dark eye sockets .It was moving fast as it was a steep grade it was coming down.Whether it was running from something or at something, i dont know.",
