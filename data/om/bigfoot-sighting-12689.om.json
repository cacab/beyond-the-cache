  "observed": "Myself and my cousin were driving to Jarrel Cove on Hartstene Island for a 2 day fishing trip. We had left my apartment in Renton about 7:30pm and headed south to Highway 3 and Hartstene. We encountered 2 deer by the road side.  We crossed the bridge to Hartstene and made the left hand turn to the campsite. I took a wrong turn and had to head back to the camp turn off when I saw a large, black, hairy biped just at the range of my truck's highbeams.  It never turned to face us.  I have seen many bears in the wild and this wasn't any bear. It had a somewhat pointed head, immense shoulders, longish arms.  I would say that it's gate was relaxed but very powerful.  The color in the headlights was a darkish brown, pepper.  I can remember seeing some of the musculature of the upper body.  It's amazing to me that I was able to analyze this all in a few seconds.  It moved up the hillside from the road.  I would say the creature was at least 2.5 meters tall. My cousin really didnt see it and thought I was joking. We went to the camp and set up even in the darkness.  I was still trying to put it all together when I heard the calls.  My cousin was asleep. I didn't feel threatened, I have never heard a call like that in the wild.  I grew up in Idaho and have heard screaming cougars, owls, elk and other creatures, but this was distinctive.  I am certain that no human could make this call.  I will consider myself very fortunate to see another one of these creatures.",
