  "observed": "It started last year when it was cool enough to sit around a fire. My husband, I and some nieghbors heard a growl or deep groan that we had never heard before coming from the woods behind our properties. The next night it was late. My husband and I were sitting around the fire and we heard what sounded like something large running and knocking down trees. My husband said, \"That was no hog or deer. They dont sound ike that.\" We ran inside the house as it got closer to us. Later that week I heard our dog whinning and barking. I looked out the back door window and I saw it. It was standing at the fence line looking in the back yard towards the fire. It was the biggest scarriest thing I've ever seen. I quitely walked away from the window and took my dog with me, in fear that the barking would bring it in closer. I burried my head under my blankets. We told people about it and no one believes us. It seems the fire brings it in. This year we are having fires again already. Late at night about 12-2am sitting by the fires the noises are back. I would love for someone to come and see if they can find this thing. It is very swampy behind us. You can literally get lost back there. Description of it: About 8-9' tall, Reddish brown colored hair, hairy all over, arms that literally hung to the knees and it stood slightly crouched. It was as if it was observing us. When it comes around there's a very pungent smell. Almost like a combination of dirty swamp water and a skunk. It's eyes are very dark almost empy looking. Width of it's body was about 4' give or take. If it ain't a bigfoot... please tell me what it is!",
