  "observed": "A few years back I lived in plymouth florida.We lived in a wooded area, in front of the house there was an orange grove. Beside us was a swamp, around that was a wooded area. I use to walk through the woods with my rifle just to feel safe. There was an old couple that had a farm across from the woods. I got to know them pretty well . I would go there for coffee. The old man and his wife would tell me stories about this Bigfoot. The farmer said that  the bigfoot comes into his garden and take his crops. \"I said Oh really\", I did not beleave him, and that was that. Until one night I was home alone with my puppy dog.We were sitting on the pourch, and you couldn't see three feet in front of you. I heard this noise brakeing through the brush. I got so scared I ran into the house, grabed my rifle and stood behind the front door,I could hardly move. Then I heard whatever it was, go around the back of the house.It tryed to get into the door. I ran out the front door into the orange groves, I kept on running. My foot got caught on a root of a tree and I fell. I rolled into the swamp, and lost my rifel. I looked back and I saw bigfoot. I got up and ran to the road. There was a truck that stoped to help. I called my friends thay came over and the whole back door was riped off. The farmer said to me ......\" I told you so\".",
