  "observed": "It was late in the afternoon, close to sundown. The time is unknown. I was hunting with my dog for about an hour, when I got a strange feeling of being watched. I dismissed the feeling as another hunter being in the area watching me. After another 10 to 15 mintues my dog ran into a thicket, he was not barking at all which was very strange to me. I called him several times and he would not respond. Then all at once he started barking, after a few seconds I heard a a scream. It was so loud I could clearly hear the sound over the dog barking. The dog quit barking and I could hear other sounds of snapping twigs and limbs. My dog came rumming out of the brush right past me in the direction of my home. I called him but he wouldn't stop. I turned back toward the area where he came from and what I saw scared the hell out of me. I was standing about 25 yards from the thicket and I could make out the outline of something standing in the brush. It was about 7 feet tall or more and very large. The plants around \"him\" were a light brown with some green mixed in. The figure was a little darker. I do not remember a smell of any kind. It seemed to be looking at me, but I couldn't tell at that distance. It began to move towards me. I could see the brush moving and I could tell that it was alive. I turned and ran and never looked back. I ran all the way home where I found my dog hiding under my Dads truck in the garage. I never told anyone this before.",
