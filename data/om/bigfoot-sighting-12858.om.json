  "observed": "The Woodlands, Texas October 18th about 12:30 am to 1 am at least. I live in a newer subdivision but are surrounded by dense forest. I take my dogs on walks late at night very often. I heard a noise somwhat of a call that I could not identify. I new it was coming from a larger animal in the distance. It could hear it clearly. It is the exact same Whooping noise that was in the 1974 recording.  I did not hear any knocking but the Whooping was the same. Now that I have a idea of what it may be, I will see about recording it. Hopefully I hear it again.",
