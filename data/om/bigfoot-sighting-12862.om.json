  "observed": "My dad and 2 of his friends and I were on a hunting trip in WV. My friend and I went to go get firewood. We got to the pile of wood with the truck and started loading. Out of nowhere some loud screams came out of the valley.  The screams sounded like a woman was being attacked. They sounded LOUD.  The lungs that belted these screams out had to be huge. I've heard some scream recordings on the Internet since then and they are similar. There is no way a human could scream this long and loud. It sounded like it was only a hundred yards away. Through the night, we heard similar screams in the distance, from more than one direction. Had to be more than one.",
