  "observed": " I have lived in Adams County, PA all of my life except for four years in the U S Navy and four years in college. I read in the Gettysburg Times tonight about your search team that is coming to Adams County. Take my story for what it is worth. On Thursday nights I would go with my mother to play bingo at the Greenmount Fife Hall on Rt 15 south of Gettysburg. I was about thirteen years old, which would have been the summer of 1961. There were other kids there and we would play hide and go seek and do all the fun stuff kids did back then. Playing bingo wasn't one of them.The firehall held shooting matches and constructed a target box in the lot behind the fire hall. I hid behind this target box during a hide and go seek game. I remember that it was dark perhaps 10PM and the area was dimly lit by the outsise lights at the firehall. I was backing around the corner of the target box and backed into a big animal. I turned to see what it was and saw this human like figure, a little over five feet tall, not really heavy, covered with hair not like a bear but long like hair on the hooves of Clydesdale horses. I remember the odor as being a musk scent like that of sweat or a deer like musk, very strong. I took off running as fast as I could go to tell the others. They or nobody else believed me and when we went back to see if anything was really there we found nothing. I often thought of that event but convinced myself that a sasquatch would not be found in a populated area such as this. Maybe I am wrong.",
