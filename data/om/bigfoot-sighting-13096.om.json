  "observed": "My girlfriend (later became wife) and I were traveling on a rural road, Panama Road, e/b e/o Cottonwood Road, that connects the outskirts of Bakersfield, CA, to Lamont, CA, a small town 14 miles outside of Bakersfield. This area is surrounded by agricultural fields, mostly grape vineyards.  I was traveling at approximately 55 mph, that was pushing it for my 65 Mustang, at the time.  As we talked, we both saw something walking very fast, almost a slow jog, across the roadway s/b. I slowed down w/o slamming on the brakes so as not to lose control and try to figure out we were seeing.  We saw its right side and back as it ran into the field.  The head to the shoulders was slouched.  Could not see a neck.  Approximately, 6 ft. tall.  Long arms, thick legs. It never looked at us as it crossed.  It was extremely dark, almost shadowy but very much real.  Appeared to be very hairy.  As we passed it,  it never looked back. I quickly stopped and began a u-turn at which time my girlfrined yelled at me asking what the hell was I doing?  She knew what I was about to do. I drove back to the location where it ran into the field and hit my brightlights.  Did not see anything.  My girlfriend was yelling at me to get going so I did.  I returned to the area the following day, but it had rained and I could not locate any footprints, too muddy. My wife will only discuss it if I bring it up, aside from that, she never talks about it.  To this day, I have no idea what we saw.  I know that it was not a human as we know it, yet I cannot say that it was a complete animal either. I still drive by there once in while and wonder what was it that we saw that night.",
