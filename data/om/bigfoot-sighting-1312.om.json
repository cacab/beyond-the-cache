Chief of police in Chetopa finds 2 and a half miles of tracks that measured 17 inches in length, 5 5/8 in width. More than 5000 people came and seen these tracks, and channel 7 news in Pittsburg reported in on there 6:00 news. After awhile the chief supposedly found what was making the tracks, which was a 6'6\" kid named Chuck Bentley, which had made some wooden footprints and had stapled them to his boots. NOTE: After researching this further I found that the facts of this kid being related to this footprints was probable not true. I feel that the chief of police was just trying to get everyone settled down, and to stop the amount of people that were coming into town..........The Chetopan, February 23, 1978",
