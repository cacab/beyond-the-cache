  "observed": "A friend of mine cornered me late one day and told me a strange tale. He was going to shoot a rifle that he owns and he said he smelled something dead or rotten. He thought maybe someone had killed a deer or another critter. As he proceeded to walk through the woods, he said he saw a huge animal hunkered staring at him.  He said the shoulders were massive. His rifle was loaded, but he felt he didn't have a big enough gun (.223 cal.) They stared at each other for a few seconds, but my friend turned to the right and proceeded forward to get away from the \"MONSTER\" (his word). He said it bolted in the same direction as he did and ran past him in a second and a half. I said was it a bear?  He said no. Was it on two legs or four? He said two. It broke tree branches as it ran thru the trees and brush. He was so scared that he did not return to the woods for 8 or 9 months, and when he did, it was with a loaded 12 gauge shotgun loaded with deer slugs. The first person he told was his wife and she laughed at him. I listened to his story and did not laugh at him because he was so serious. I will say this, he didn't know about the bigfoot sites or even mention the name bigfoot during the telling of this tale. One other thing, he was carrying a bag of apples, he felt later that the MONSTER was after that. That part of the story I know is true. I saw the bag! I read your reports, and can tell you I don't know whether to believe them or not. I think my friend saw something strange and was scared. He warned me not to go into those woods any more. I said bigfoot didn't eat you so he won't eat me. He said he wanted to post a sign next to the woods that said \"MONSTER IN THE WOODS\", but I said no because I didn't need every guy in Indy with a 300 magnun chasing a myth or legend.  I said if you did see a bigfoot, your one lucky guy!  This is the truth.  No hoax.  Thanks",
