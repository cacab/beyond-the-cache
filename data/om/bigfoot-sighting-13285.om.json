  "observed": "My family and I went to Ludlow, Vermont for Columbus Day weekend since we enjoy the northeastern woods. We all enjoy observing the local flora and fauna in their natural settings and we often drive and/or walk the back roads looking for deer, moose, bear and whatever else we can spot. One evening we went \"Moose Spotting\" on Tyson Road since during a summer trip to the same area, earlier, we had observed eight moose in one evening. As we drove along Tyson Road I saw a large bipedal form cross the road in two strides. I asked one of my daughters, \"Did you see that? Tell me what did you see.\" I purposely didn't say what I'd seen since I wanted to know if she'd seen what I'd seen. I wanted to be sure I had not imagined it. Very quickly she said, \"I don't know what it was but it was real big, maybe eight feet tall, hairy and crossed the road in two steps.\" She saw the same thing I did.  It crossed the road about 50 feet ahead of us and judging from the trees where it crossed the road I'd say her height estimate is accurate +/- 20%. My other daughter didn't see it since she was in the back seat and was looking out the side windows of the car. I still don't quite believe it but I know what bear, deer and moose look like in natural settings since I've been hunting for 40 years. It wasn't anything I had ever seen in the woods. It walked across the road in two strides, was heavily built, covered in short dark hair and, as stated previously, approximately eight  feet tall. One more thing.  The day before, we had driven the same area, didn't see anything at all, no fauna at all, but we did hear some very odd vocalizations that sound very much like the recordings available on your website.",
