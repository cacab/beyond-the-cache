  "observed": "I was a girl.  I think it was 1969-70 and I was 10-11 years old.  I was sick and sleeping on the couch in the living room.  I heard our dog whining. He never whined. No stranger let alone an animal could come close to our dog as he was an agressive watchdog. The whining is what woke me up.  I looked out the window from the couch and then looked again trying to focus. It was dark and everybody else was sleeping. I saw a dark outline of a creature looking into the front room.  I saw its silhouette against the night sky.  It had to have been taller than 6 foot, and the window, if I remember correctly, was off the ground 3? feet and the window itself was 4? feet tall.  The creature took up the width of the window and there probably was about 6-8 inches of moonlit sky showing above its head.  It made no sound.  It just stood there looking in.  I don't remember anything else.  I probably thought I must be dreaming, but the impression of something watching me never left me and I never told anyone about it until I told a trusted friend about a year ago.  However, other members of my family, including myself at that period of time, heard sounds that summer--like a low, steady whistle, sounding almost like a wind blowing through a groove of some kind.  This happened more than once.  When one of my uncles investigated with a rifle one night while we were playing cards, he came back shaken and unable to explain why.  The night would be silent except for the whistle noise. Another time, I went exploring down the creek which ran out of a pond.  I got to the bottom of the ravine.  There was a smell, like sulphur, or something rotting, at a place where the water pooled.  It scared me and I ran back up the mountain.  I did not tell anyone because I was not suppose to go beyond the sight of the house.",
