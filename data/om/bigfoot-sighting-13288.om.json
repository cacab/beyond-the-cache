  "observed": "I saw one in Napoli, NY, by Sawmill Run Rd. It was October 2000. My dad and I were hunting turkey on state land we were walking slow and quietly stopping and looking around. We were about 20 yards apart and we were both looking SE. I turned slowly and didn't see anything, but then did see movement in front of me. I pulled up my gun, ready for a turkey. It was about 20 yards away and I didn't shoot. I didn't know what it was. It was on two legs, all brown-red hair all over it and at least six feet tall. It took off running like a big guy, but swift. It ran down hill away from me and was out of sight. My dad was still looking the other way. I wish he saw it to, but he didn't.",
