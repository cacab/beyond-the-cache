  "observed": "This happened in the spring of 1975 in Pennsville N.J.  This part of town backed up to a wooded area that in turn merged with the wildlife refuge at Finns Point.  I lived in an apartment complex that backed up to the woods.  I was eleven  years old at the time but remember it like yesterday.  I was just after dark and I was taking the garbage out to the dumpster.  Two friends of mine came running from behind the building in a panic.  I ask what was wrong and they said they had seen a huge whitesh covered creature at the edge of the woods.  These kids were a year or two younger then me.  Me being the older decided to get my fathers 12 volt spotlight and take a look. As we made our way to the woods about 65 feet behind the nearest apartment, my flashlight caught a pair of glowing red eyes. About fifty feet from the edge of the woods.  There appeared to be a large creature on two legs behind a stand of trees.  The hair on my neck stood up and we all ran to tell our parents.  No one believed us.",
