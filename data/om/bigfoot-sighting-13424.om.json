  "observed": "I was travelling down a couty road from a friends camp, and I was riding a small Honda motorbike.  I got past a turn and heard something akin to a flat tire flopping.  My bike is small enough that if it had a flat tire, I'd know it.  I was doing about 15 mph and looked back after going around a right-hand curve crossing a creek.  I saw what looked to be a hairy human figure, about 6-6 1/2' tall, running behind my bike.  Scared the crap out of me, so I hit the thottle and did what I could to get out of there.",
