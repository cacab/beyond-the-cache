  "observed": "Back in the summer of 1981, my then fiance' and his twin brother and his fiancee' were just driving through the \"Mooseyards\" as young people do, and pulled off to the side to just \"sit\" and whatever (it's been awhile) with the back of the car facing the road and the headlights to the woods.  As we were talking, we all noticed some eyes shining in the trees ahead of us.  We all just casually commented as to whether it was a bear, but no, it was up to high.  Well then it must be an owl because it was at least 8 feet up or so. The driver then put on his brights and now we saw a huge figure standing there which then just casually turned to it's left and started to walk.  We didn't wait to see any more because we all yelled and the driver of our car immediately floored it in reverse and we sped away.   We all went home and compared notes on our observations along with the twins trying to draw the creature.  We made the decision to not tell anyone because we knew we'd be called nuts.  We sure would of said that about anyone telling us that story. The next day, in daylight, we went back to that location and observed the tops of the wild grass in that area was burned in a large circular pattern. I have know idea if it is related or not.  Just odd. We never talked much about it again except occasionally my husband now and again.  Now I live in the area again and am very curious because we are building a house in the \"Mooseyard\" and wanted to know after seeing a program on T.V. about your site, if anyone else saw anything similar in the area. My husband being better with directions can drive right to the sight.",
