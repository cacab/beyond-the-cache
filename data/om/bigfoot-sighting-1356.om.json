  "observed": "My husband and I were jugging on the Missouri River.  We had the jugs all set out and was floating down behind them, when we saw something big and hairy on the bank getting a drink.  At first we could not see it that well, but the closer we got, the better we could see it.  It stood upon two legs and looked around for a few minutes.  It did not see us at first and it did not hear us because we had the motor off and I guess he finely saw us because he walked back up the bank into the tree area.  As he was walking, we could see trees falling, it looked like some type of machiner was going through there knocking them down, but there was no noise other than the sound of the trees being knocked down.  All my husband and I could do was look at each other.  I guess because neither one of us could believe what we saw for years.  We did not tell anyone because we did not want anyone to think we were crazy.",
