I estimate aroud 7/1/2 - 8ft ft tall.After the incident I went upstairs and my mother told me the next morning that she felt like she was being watched for about 3 hrs. and was quite unerved by the whole thing. ---------------- [From the aunt of the witness above, who lives roughly one mile away, bordering the same stretch of woods:] It was late June around 3:00A.M. it was hot humid night being a sound sleeper, I was awakened by a loud sound, one I have never heard in my life I live near a State forest called Salmon River State park in East Hampton CT, for almost 25 years. I know all the animal sounds , as I am an animal lover, avid hiker and camper . I have never heard such  an animal sound like this  It was an incredible kind of screaming. It lasted for several minutes. The closest I have ever heard was on your site. I live in Moodus Ct, in Middlesex County.",
