  "observed": "We were walking (my hunting partner and I) down the road trying to spot a grouse that we had just seen fly from the area of the swamp to the timber across the road from it. We were standing on the north side of the road looking up in the trees and trying to figure how to get off the road in the dense underbrush to get a shot at the grouse. I got a funny fealing that something was watching us and could smell a strong smell kinda like a wet elk. (That season was open too and that was basically why we were hunting). I turned around and walked to the other side of the road away from Joe and looked in at the swamp. I didn't see anything at first, then I saw something very big move. It looked like the back of a bull elk so I spun around and gave a loud whisper to my partner (ELK)! By the time he walked the half dozen steps or so from where he was, to me the thing had stood up. I know it heard me even though I know I was pretty quiet. It scared the heel out of me when it did this. I knew right there and then it wasn't an elk. As it stood up, it came from a position from squating between it's legs to a full stance. Just then he saw it and remarked to me, \"what the hell is that thing\"? I said you ain't gonna believe this but that is a Bigfoot. He was worried about our safety and said, should we shoot it? Can we kill it? I said I don't think we should, we might get in big trouble with the law and he had been there before. So we watched it for a few minutes. It was very warry of us and kept rocking back and forth nervously. If we made any movements it would duck it's head a few inches and stare at us. He was worried about it attacking us. It made a posturing movement like it meant business so I said let's shoot into the road and see if we can scare it off, so we did and it did. It took off like a bat outta hell in the direction away fro us. He said, ain't nobody in hell gonna believe us, they'll lock us up in the nutt house if we do. We agreed right there and then to stay silent. This happened in the mid 1980's and I haven't said anything about it to anyone but the wife and kids and a few people I trust.",
