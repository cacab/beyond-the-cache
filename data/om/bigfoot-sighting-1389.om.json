  "observed": "My dad and I were taking a hike on Grass Mountain. We went back on an old unused logging road, we hiked up about a mile and a half and we decided to take a little break. We were sitting down eating and we heard a deep bubbly moaning and groaning sound coming from behind my back. We looked around for about ten minutes and we couldn't see anything, but it sounded like it was close to us. It was starting to confuse us so we started to go back down the trail, we were walking faster and there was a strange feeling that we were being followed. After about five minutes of walking fast we heard a rib cage rattling scream behind us that just about scared me stiff. Then there was another one from the west farther away followed by another one from around the southeast. Soon we got down to our truck and drove home. I'm glad I'm not the only believer!
