  "observed": "Just as dawn was breaking my 2 year old son, (who refused to sleep in the tent, which is why I was still sitting by the fire)and I heard a low, hollow, bone chilling scream. It  was a sound I could only classify as a big foot. It had LUNG CAPPACITY! It was also high pitch as well as very deep and it was intentional. Because the cry started went on for a minute or so (It seemed like forever) and abruptly stopped.  Then a small pause. Then the Exact, Same Cry again.  Beginning length of noise and an abrupt silence. There were Three all together. My son asked me what it was and I couldn’t tell him. I finally said, I think it's a bigfoot. It was July of 1997 and we were the early campers who had arrived on Wed. Most of the other vacationers wouldn’t be out until Friday. My theory is that the bigfoot was headed down to the water for his/her morning bath/drink and saw all of the tents and vehicles and yelled back to whoever \"The freaken Campers are Here!\"  As a warning. The sound We Heard was Indescribable. Guttural, hollow, High pitched and intentional. Unless Pavarati was in the Forrest playing tarzan (I’m kidding), It was a bellow that carried over the valley, and it was scary, and when it was just cut off at the end, the sound didn’t die out, it was loud, and then it was over.",
