  "observed": "This occurred while I was just standing enjoying the view of the woods not far from my house,  I had my dog with me and I was not actually in the woods myself but across the creek from the woods.  Whatever it was, was just a sighting.  Nothing was found, nothing was heard. I saw a bipedal creature from the waist down.  The rest of it was hidden by leaves on trees.  The legs that I saw were quite stocky and were not bent in any way,  The hair was quite long, I would say maybe 4 or 5 inches long.  The color was a golden reddish brown. As I watched,  whatever this was appeared to know that I had seen it because it turned slowly and took a few steps and disappeared in the underbrush. I had been standing there with a grip on my shepherds collar (thank goodness) but the dog never noticed anything.  The creature made no noise and was perhaps 100 feet from me across a 4 foot deep creek bed (almost dry). After this I did not go on this section of the property for about 6  years  I have never told anyone about this,  I have never seen anything since this one sighting and I will probably never know what it was.  I don't think it was a bear standing on two legs  because the legs appeared to be too long and too straight up and down..",
