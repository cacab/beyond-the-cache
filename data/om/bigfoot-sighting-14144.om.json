  "observed": "In 1987 as my college roommate and I were on our way home from a football game I saw a large humanoid creature that was covered with hair cross the road in front of us then stopped to look at us as we drove by. When I first saw the creature it was walking across the road. By the time we got to it, it was on the side of the road and appeared to turn its head toward the car and look at us. We drove past it and continued on down the road. We were very frightened and drove on to my roommates mom's house where we woke her up and told her. The creature appeared to be at least 7 feet tall, humanoid and completely covered in brown hair. It walked upright and straight on two legs. Its body was stocky or muscular in appearance. I do not remember many facial features as the face was obscured by some hair. The hair appeared straight. I have lived in rural areas almost my whole life and I am very familiar with the appearance of animals on the road at night and what they look like. I can say with complete confidence that what I saw was not an ordinary animal.",
