  "observed": "I was on my home from work in Bishopville, traveling on Hwy. 15 at approximately 2:10am. I had a near miss with a large deer near Lydia that had me shaken and alert for other possible deer on the road. I made the left turn on hwy 15 to 15 north and I drove about 3 miles when I noticed a large shape on the other lane ahead of my car about 100 yards, I assumed that it was another deer so I slowed my car down to about 30 to 40 mph to allow time for the animal to cross over. as I approached nearer to this shape I noticed that it was human like because it was standing erect on 2 legs and it had arms like a man however, when I got within 40 ft of this creature I realized that it wasn't a bear or a deer and that it appeared to be very tall. I floored it... I was very afraid, I didn't know what to expect, but I knew that I was safer than a sitting duck. As I passed this creature, It seemed like it lunged towards my car and nearly took off my side mirror. I looked out of my drivers side window and noticed that its shoulders were above the top of my van and I also noticed that it was covered in hair that was light in color. I did not see the face of this creature, only its body and the outline of it as I approached.",
