  "observed": "Heard very loud screams. The screams were louder than anything I ever heard in my life. Did not sound like any animal or bird I ever heard anywhere. Every hair on my body was standing on end. I heard it walking around my tree stand less than fifty yards away. I thought it was a deer or my hunting partner coming over until it started screaming. I was in a climbing tree stand and opted to jump out rather than shimmy down because I didn't want to lower my bow to the ground. It followed me all the way out of the woods to the road I was parked on. When I came out on the road my hunting partner was standing on the roof of my car with his bow drawn back. He could not get into the car because I had the keys in my pocket.",
