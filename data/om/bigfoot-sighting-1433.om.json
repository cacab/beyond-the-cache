  "observed": "This incident occured in late July early August 2000,My wife had been fishing with me on a couple of occasions earlier that season , but was wanting to go where the weeds werent so high ,I had found a place that was popular for folks that like to catfish .We arrived there at about 3 pm , to set up our gear before nightfall.originally we planned to stay till midnight if the fishing was good, we had brought coffee and snacks , enjoying the chance to be out together, she kept me fairly busy baiting her hooks and re-rigging her line, We had a couple bites , lost some hooks etc. It was pitch dark at about 9:30 ,but the lanterns kept the area well lit almost back to our pick-up it was parked back behind us about 75 or 100 ft. at the top of the boat ramp. The noise started behind us to the left ,it was rustling sound that became a loud snapping and cracking that seemed to come closer ,there was a thumping sound as well this lasted maybe a couple of minutes , we stood there looking in the area expecting someone to come out into the light.My wife was visibly shaken ,but I re-assured her \"it was probably a deer\".I hoped to re-assure myself as well,encouraging her to get her line back in the water, I kept glancing back in that direction cause I knew we werent alone out there now ,as we recast our lines something ran across the gravel road behind us,the gravel scattered under its weight,into the tree line along the side of my pick-up ,as it went along side ,whatever it was \"slapped \" the truck bed ,three times quickly , then there was cracking and breaking of limbs on that side of the woods.The lanterns were glowing on the underside of the branches above as they shook and swayed the \"thumping\" was its feet on the ground,i felt it. We both had already dropped our poles , My pistol was hammer back and aimed that direction , my wife was behind me holding onto my belt loops we were ready to go ,but afraid to go toward the truck,something was over there ! \"that aint no deer \" she said \"thats somebody\" We stood there for a couple of minutes (seemed like a hour)I felt it was right there watching us ! When we did get to the pick-up I opened drivers door so fast it broke the retaining spring on the hinge ,I put her in and locked the door ,wanted to see if there were dents in the side of bed,I walked around to the dark side of the truck with my flashlight,(the feeling of being watched at a disadvantage was overwhelming )when my wife started the engine ....I thought my heart stopped ! After I stumbled back around to the drivers side I turned on all of the lights (even the interior) swung around ,backed down to where the gear was . got up enough nerve to get out and reel in the lines and gather up the stuff,  while loading I felt as though I was about to be \"approached \" by something .I was scared ...And then when it screamed ,I did too!It sounded loud and close , the sound echoed out into the deep woods, it was unearthly,high pitched,short but it had a lot of emphasis,if it meant to hurry us along..... It worked ! we left there fast ! When we arrived home we told our sons about what had happened because they had occasionally went there to fish as well..Lately we have heard other stories from this area as well,theres something out there .. Im thankful to be able to share this with others who are interested .Told our new game warden about it a couple of weeks after the incident he seemed surprised ,and was quite interested , but had his own explanation, teenagers !
