  "observed": "Myself and four friends we're sitting around a campfire listening to a very loud car stereo when 2 of the party simultaneously said shhh shhh what the hell is that, and 1 ran to the truck and turned the stereo off. Seconds later we all heard a loud aggressive, violent, bellowing and deep throated sound that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and made others run for their guns and others their trucks. The hardest part of this event is the adjectives needed to descibe the sound we all heard. After listening to the sound recordings on your website, I and the group decided that the 1978 Snohomish County sound clip and the 1973 Puyallup Washington sound clips are close but not exactly what we heard. This sound was fierce, massive and came from a pair of lungs that nothing short of 600 lbs could produce. We all agreed the sound came through the local canyons roughly 1 to 2 hundred yards away. The 2nd vocalization seemed to come from only 50 yards away and the 3rd and 4th came from 100 yards away as if it moved unnaturely fast from 1 position to another. We all listened to known animal sounds from the net and nothing comes close to this.",
