  "observed": "My husband works on a huge ranch (about 750 acres) outside of Quitman Texas.  The area is heavily wooded.  He often has to trap wild hogs on the property because they tear up and root up everything.  Anyway, he was at the very back of the property checking traps and he saw something run behind a tree.  It was very big, hairy, and running on two feet.  He said the color was charcoal gray and it was about 6 feet tall.  He did not see it again after it hid behind the tree because he left the area immediately.  It really scared him and he says that it reminded him of a huge monkey or ape.  The area that this took place is very secluded with nothing but thick woods all around.",
