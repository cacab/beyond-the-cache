  "observed": "This happened around1986-1987. I was fishing in a quarry pond, Antrim lake in columbus ohio. It was around 6am and the water was calm. Out in the middle of the lake, bubbles started to rise, then it got more violent, almost like a giant coffee pot percolating. Up burst a huge white \"thing\".i was about, 10 feet away. It was out in the lake and i was sitting on the shore. It swam to the other side of the lake got out , walked up the bank and disappered into the woods on the other side. that border the Olentangy river. It seemed quite large but i didnt realize how big until about a half hour later, another person showed up and started riding their bycicle around the lake,it had a track, it was about a mile around,but i waited for the byciclist to get to the spot where the:thing\" got out of the water, and it was as tall as a man on a bike. So i estimate it at about 6 ft tall. 250-300 pounds and all white. I have told my wife about this over the years but she just makes fun of me. I know what i saw, and it was big, white and came up out of the lake in the very earling morning. maybe it didnt anticipate me being there, and swam directly to the other side. i do remember doing some kind of research on bigfoots in Ohio, and read about a report in the Olentngy river around 1943 or so. thats my story ...true",
