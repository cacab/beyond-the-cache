  "observed": "I was patroling an area near the University of North Florida, when something caught my attention on the side of the road. I turned around and went back to the spot to get a better look. When I was in the woods I noticed several strange limb and tree formations. i saw arches T.P. formations and some \"X\" formations. I noticed that these were up close to the road\\. As I walked around and investigated the area I felt as if I was being watched. I heard some movement in the brush. I thought it may have been just an animal that I am used to. I tried to move to get a better look at what was in the brush. I never made a good visual. I found it strange that what ever it was did not flee. It was shadowing my movements and using the brush and lighting conditions to remain out of my sight. I did smell a smell that was like the smell of a dog that had dried off naturally after playing in standing water. The are of this incident was wooded and wetlands. It leads down into a swampy area and a creek that traverses the highway to a larger wooded area. Fell free to contact me for more information. I am willing to show this area to an investigator if you have one in the Jacksonville area.",
