  "observed": "My friend E and I found a great spot to fish, the only problem was the place was the Seattle watershed which is off limits to the public. The best way to enter was in the middle of the night this way you could avoid the patrol they have there. I believe it is a 5 mile hike to where the best spot is, right by the crib dam. The first 2 miles is uphill then its flat. We of course used the service road, the first couple of times we actually hiked to the lake via no road or trail just straight up. By now we used our bicyle's which made the journey much more easy. It was the summer of 1996 September was the month the weather was warm no breeze just a great northwest day. We had gone in at about 4am in the cover of darkness. We had fished until around 11am then hung out until around 8pm so we could use the darkness to get out. On our way out riding on the road we hit a wall of this smell that we had never encountered before. It was rancid. Both of us hunt and have been around dead animals, been close to black bears and other things. We searched both sides of the road and could not find a thing. Remember there was no wind and we had passed this spot a few hours before. Then both of us at the same time got this sence that we where being watched, it was crazy, there was nothing moving no birds or anything. It was a 6th sence but we both had it at the same time. I get hairs standing on my neck right now just typing this.  Anyway we made it out fine, have not been back. I know this is not a sighting but I know how I felt at the time it happend.",
