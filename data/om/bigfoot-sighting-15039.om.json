  "observed": "I cannot say this is a Bigfoot event.  I did not SEE what was happening - I only HEARD it. I was outside early one morning in June, 2005 - around 0600 - when I heard perhaps three dogs start to bark.  They were perhaps two or three blocks away (the forest is very near there) when they began. This went on for a couple of minutes until the dogs began to bark louder and more fiercely.  Then I heard a very loud howl, which certainly didn't sound like any dog I've ever heard.  It reminded me of a Gibbon call in the zoo; more ape-like than dog. The dogs continued to bray, and the howler got louder and tended to drown them out. It did not sound like a fight but rather, a bunch of animals having a verbal argument over their respective territories. This went on for several minutes - perhaps 5 - until the animals grew tired of their noisy discourse.  It presently stopped. I did not see any of my neighbors out and about so am not sure who if anyone else heard this. I am not a believer in Bigfoot per se, but since being up here and that episode, I have to wonder.",
