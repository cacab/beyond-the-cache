  "observed": "2 weeks ago i went into the pine barrons in manchester nj ,deep in forest to shoot a pistol. i left the gun in the car and scoped out the area before i started shooting. i started down a trail and when i turned the corner i heard heavy heavy footsteps run away from me and smell a skunky/homeless person type oder. i looked around area but saw nothing. then i walked in another direction and found a stream or pond.  then something threw a rock into the water making a good size splash. i now went back to the truck and got my gun when i went back to the trail. i saw nothing but thought this might be a bigfoot. couldnt stop thinking about it so i went back a couple days later with a bigger gun and an axe. when i got to the spot where this hapened i heard a loud call like choom choom choom choom. this startled me and i cocked the hammer. i then heard footsteps coming tawards me in the thick vegitation. it came within 15 feet away and stopped. i could not see it through the brush. with my gun pointed in its direction it threw a large stick that landed along side of me.  i said \"hello ?\"  any body there, but no reply. i almost emptyed the gun into the bush but desided not to because i cuoldnt see the creature. i could smell it ,feel it, here it, and it threw something at me twice! i backed off and walked back to my truck the whole time ready to shoot if it atacked me.when i reached the truck this thing let out another call only much louder and much closer choom choom many times. a small bird on a tree branch began to act crazy. i took this warning and left. this sunday i went back with food, i took food to the spot where it threw the stick and backed away. then i heard some vocalizeations and got one of them on mini disc recording. sounds kinda like / coo coo kaa kaakaa coo coo ka kakka. went back to the trail to see if food was gone and was met by more stange bird behavior. many birds fleww rapidly out of trail as if some thing scared them out. when i looked down the trail i heard a loud snap of a tree or branch being broken. i backed away and soon after heard some low moans and groans, much too low to be a person. i also smelled the same oder again. this thing has an exeptional abilty to hide. all three times it was very close to me but for some reason i could not see it. i am convinced this is a sasqatch or more than one of them. i can take you or researchers to this place in nj pine barrons. this story is not a hoax and i dont beleive a person would be dumb enough to throw sticks and rocks at a man with a gun! i saw alot of good size trees (5or6inchdiameter) broken in half.",
