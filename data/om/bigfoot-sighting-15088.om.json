  "observed": "I had been told about recent Bigfoot sightings in this area, so I’d been on the lookout for Bigfoot and sign ever since.  I knew that many sightings had occurred after rainfall.  One night last August, after a day of bad storms that ended by evening, on a whim I decided to drive to this park at night.  It was an eerie night with distant lightning flashes in the sky.  There’s a road that leads to a parking lot.  At one point the road sharply veers to the right into the parking lot.  If you were to go straight, you would be driving down a private drive. As I turned down this road, looking straight ahead down this private lane, I saw big eyes looking back at me.  There was one set of very large, close together, blue-white eyes high off the ground.  They almost looked cartoonish in shape, they were so large.  They were oval and sort of cocked toward each other like a cartoon figure.  They were totally unthreatening looking – in fact, my impression was of a gentle and frightened creature.  Halfway down this large creature I saw several smaller blue-white eyes.  I never saw a “pair”, though.  They were just random blue-white dots in several places halfway down the creature.  When I first saw the eyes, I stopped my car and just stared in disbelief.  The eyes didn’t move for several seconds.  Then the tall big-eyed creature’s eyes started to sway back and forth.  When it did that, the shorter eyes all started to move, appearing and disappearing and moving around in a smooth and floating manner.  I never saw figure shapes or fur.  Just eyes.  When everything started moving, I panicked unfortunately, turned my car around and got out of there as fast as I could.  What can I say?  I’m a female and I was alone at night in a park looking at strange eyes.  I went to my sister’s house 10 minutes from there and told her about it.  She got her son and his girlfriend, and the four of us went back to the sighting area to explore it with flashlights.  We saw nothing – no prints or sounds or smells.  However, it was a noisy night insect wise, but when we walked in the sighting area, it was eerily quiet.  Two things I noticed.  By seeing my nephew and sister in the same spot where I saw the eyes, it was apparent that the adult creature was much taller than they are.  Also, I was able to clearly see my relatives’ shapes and clothing.  I couldn’t see the creature’s shape, so it (they) must have been very dark from top to bottom.  My general impression was that I stumbled upon a female with her young children out walking around after the heavy rains that day.",
