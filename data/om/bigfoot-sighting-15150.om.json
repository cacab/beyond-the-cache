  "observed": "My boyfriend was driving me and some friends through  a wooded area near Mio, Michigan. It is some dirt roads to the left of 33(This was my first time to this part so I am not certain, exactly where I was).  We were cruising along looking at the woods that had been recently burned down. Down the road right after this hill, my boyfriend and I both saw a white figure crossing the road. Jokingly he says \"there is sasquatch\", we both just assumed it was a human since it was walking upright across the road. I was unsure how how big it was since we were far down the road. When we got over the hill, I made a reference to seeing something and figuring it was a human wondering why there wasnt a car in sight. We then began talking about how strange this whole thing was. We went back to the area we saw him crossing the road and looked for footprints but the road didnt show prints. We speculated on the reasons for someone being in the deserted woods. Needless to say, we drove around in circles for an hour looking. I had the weirdest feeling in my stomach knowing I saw something different. I did not really think I saw a sasquatch until I came home and did a little research.",
