  "observed": "My friend and I wanted to go fishing at bear pond so we left my house at about 6 pm. We went topwater fishing because of the approaching sunset. We went in a canoe and fished along the edge of the entire pond.  It started to get too dark to cast accurately considering all of the trees along the edge overhang the water. We decided to start heading to the docking area to go home. By now it was completely dark and there are no houses in the back part of the pond just woods and rivers and some preety steep hills that go on forever.We were at a complete stop in the canoe between the mainland and an island when all of a sudden we both heard a loud scream comming from the mainland up on a hill. It sounded like a mix between a young girl screaming and a weard bird like sound.We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that\".Again it happened and again. Just as the sound stopped something started to RUN in the mainland woods about 50 yards from us.The sound was very loud like crashing and running. Something was watching us very quietly because we had passed that area along the edge of the water about 20 minutes earlier.  Anyway, this thing was definitely on two legs running towards the screaming sound on the hill. It must have ran 100 feet in 7 seconds. I must tell you that there was a new moon that night so it was pitch black out. When the thing was running it broke sticks and branches and was very loud almost running urgently and clumsily. At that point it stopped completely by the screaming sound we heard seconds ago. My friend and I both sat there stunned in the canoe; our eyes looking toward the direction of where the running stopped. We sat there for almost an hour listening but we only heard small twigs breaking nothing else. We eventually left but we both know what it was. We are both in our mid 20's and are avid outdoorsman and know that whatever we heard was not a bear or deer.",
