  "observed": "I would like to preface this report with a small fact: I have always wanted to see a Bigfoot.  I truly believe that I have, based on what i saw tonight. I work for a monitoring lab that conducts late-night bat surveys.  Very recently we were commissioned to do a survey to look for Myotis sodalis, the Indiana bat.  We had to make sure that the bats were not roosting on an active mine site. On the second night of our 6-day survey, my coworker and I were going to check one of the nets when we heard a very loud whooping howl nearby (within 30 feet of where we were standing).  It was late at night, probably around 1:30 in the morning.  At first I thought the sound was a person, trying to scare us by making howling noises.  After the creature vocalized a second time, however, i knew the noise wasn't made by a man.  I refused to move from my spot, scanning the tree line with my light.  I didn't see anything then, but i heard rustling in the woods of something large moving. The next night i was on a different part of the survey, but 2 more of my coworkers were in the same area i was in the night before.  They told us at the end of our shift that they had heard noises in the woods, and saw a place that had been trampled down by something much larger than a deer or bear. Finally, on the last night of our survey, I was back in the area i heard the noise on the second day.  I was in a good mood, because i hadn't heard any strange noises since that first one.  As i went to check the nets with 2 of my coworkers at around 2:30 in the morning (in the same area as before) I heard a single, high-pitched \"whoop\".  I  jumped but was prepared, and shone my light in the direction of the noise.  about 40 yards in front of us, a large bipedal creature crossed the road.  It was tall, probably around 7 feet, and was completely covered in short, coarse-looking black hair except for its face, which was brown.  The creature looked at the 3 of us as it crossed the road, took two steps, and was gone up the embankment on the other side. The 3 of us ran back to my truck, where one of my coworkers grabbed a machete.  When my boss and another technician showed up, the 5 of us walked to where I had seen the Bigfoot.  In the mud were 2 distinct footprints, each much larger than any of our shoes.  in the direction that the Bigfoot had walked in was trampled down grasses and broken twigs, as if something very big had moved quickly through the brush.  We promptly packed up our nets and left, all of us were extremely scared.  I plan on going back soon and trying to extract as much evidence as I can find.",
