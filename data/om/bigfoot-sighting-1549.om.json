  "observed": "This is my story; not very many people believe this. When I was about 5 yrs old we lived in Hiouchi, Ca (1983). One day in the fall, I was staring out my living room window (it faced the woods), and I noticed something really big and hairy. It was standing up on two feet, and dark brown in color. It was about 25 feet away from the window. The creature walked right in between two trees that faced my living room window and just stood there and stared at me. I didn't even think of moving. It stood there for a while, it was probably five minutes or so, but back then those five minutes felt like forever! Then it just turned around and walked back into the woods. I know that it wasn't a bear because it did it all on two feet. I still remember all this and it happened a long time ago. I did tell my mom but she said that I probably saw a bear, but I know it was not a bear.",
