  "observed": "In 1990 + - I am not sure of the year I was going to the beach down hwy 220 south with my husband, he did not see any thing.  As best I can remember we were close to Candor NC, where 211 toward Pinehurst and Aberdenn NC comes together though it is a very rural area farms and woods.  There is an area where it is very straight and slightly a long grade going down hill so you can see for a long way. I am not good with distance but I saw something big and black/brown come out of the woods go across the 4 lane and vanish in to the woods on the other side.  Now I was going 60 +- miles an hour it was so fast it looked like it was gliding sort of and swinging it's arms.  Of course my husband, now ex-husband did not see anything.  I got to the place in the road where it crossed and thought to my self what the hell was that!  It had to have been big for me to have seen it that far away.  I have always wondered until I came upon your web site and it was like a bell went off in my head.",
