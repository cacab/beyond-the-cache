  "observed": "This story is a story that my mom told me.  She says it happened when she was young, back in the late 60s, maybe early 70s, I would guess.  I will confirm this with her. My family used to have a cabin near and North of Dillon, Colorado off of Highway 9.  There is a \"Blue River Campground\" there.  The private road we would take to the cabin is directly across Hwy 9 from the entrance to this campground.  My uncle and aunt, 20 years older than my mom, bought this cabin back in the 60s, they had it until around 1990, when I was 10, so I have been to the locations described in this report.  My mom was in her teens when this happened.  I am not, however, familiar with how the land is currently being used, as I have not been there since the cabin was sold.  I doubt the cabin is even there anymore, it did not have electric or water service.  Only a Propane stove with about a 60 gallon propane drum and an outhouse.  Rural extremist-cabins have taken hold in the area surrounding Dillon, CO since the early 90s and many large-scale cabins have been erected in that area, so I don't know if that area is still private or not. This road led into a privately owned cattle ranch, there was a gate we needed to open & close as we went through, so traffic and any other people were very infrequent when I was a kid.  It was probably even more so at the time of the incident my mother has told me about. Once at the cabin, you could head up an old logging-road turned to trail, up the mountain kind of following the runoff creek & find a beaver dam/pond about 3/4 to 1 mile up the trail.  We would fish here & catch many little rainbow trout.  Farther up the trail/mountain was another beaver pond, I would guess maybe an additional 1/2-1 mile up the trail. When I was 10 and under, I would often walk and explore these woods alone.  I always thought this story my mom told me was just to scare me into staying close to the cabin.  I would often wander But, now, we no longer own the cabin and I am 26; she claims this story was always true. The technical owners of this cabin, my aunt and uncle had a son, my cousin, that was very close to my mom's age.  They would spend a lot of time at the cabin in his and my mom's younger years with the family.  My cousin had a small dirt bike, that he and my mom would ride tandem on through the forest there. She said when they were young, they had taken a ride up the trail together on the dirt bike, my cousin driving and my mom riding on the seat behind him.  She said it was a tight fit, and she would almost fall off.  They passed the first beaver pond and continued up the trail to the 2nd.  When you approach the 2nd beaver pond, the trail rises up this hill and the beaver pond is located kind of on a plateau of land.  So, you come up over the burm from the trail and reach the plateau where you can see the entire beaver pond, it was only about 50-75 feet across, and the edge of the pond was surrounded by a fairly good amount of open land, when I would go there, I remember about 10-30 feet of grass between the pond and the trees.  It seems the beavers built the pond in what was a creek going through a meadow and it filled up most of the meadow. She said as they approached the burm leading up to the plateau, my cousin saw it first.  He whipped the dirt bike around to head back down the hill, saying some explitives about what he just saw.  My mom, being in the back did not see it until the bike spun around and she slid off the back onto her feet.  There was a large, very large, white creature squatting down on the edge of the pond, with its knees on either side of its body, reaching down into the water.  It was covered in 5-7\" white furr.  Its body was bulky and muscular.  Obviously not a bear, as only black bears and the rare grizzly bear are located in this area.  There are no creatures covered fully in white furr.  My family, being a \"redneck-type\" of family, are full of hunters, campers and hikers.  We all know what a white-tailed deer, Elk, Bears, Mountain Lion, Porkupine, Bobcats, etc...look like.  She said this thing must have weighed at least 700-800 lbs.  Because it was squatting down, height could not be estimated accurately. By the time my mom saw it, my cousin was already beginning to go as quickly as he could back down the trail.  She took a quick couple of seconds glance at this creature.  I need to verify if she noticed it react in any way and how far away from it they were when they saw it.  They headed quickly down the trail terrified as she tried to stay on the seat, but mostly slid off and was halfway riding and running behind the dirt bike trying to keep up. As a kid, I was told many stories of these mostly aspen covered woods.  Most were just campfire tales to scare us, but this one was for real.  Even 20-30 years later as I was a boy exploring those woods...after I heard this story, I never went farther than the first beaver pond because I was always creeped out because of this tale.  From time to time, I remember feeling like something was watching me.  Not always, but sometimes.  Thinking back on it now, I think I must have been crazy to wander around those woods alone being under 10 years old.  I read this site and the reports in the 60's & 70's in Colorado.  I saw other posts of reports of a creature with white fur.  This prompted me to post this story my mom told me.  Perhaps it was still in those woods when I was a boy, or perhaps its relatives or offspring.  Perhaps one of these things are what I felt watching me from time to time.",
