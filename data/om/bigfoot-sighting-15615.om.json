  "observed": "I was looking around on the internet last night and ran onto to your site and it brought back a memory of something that happened to me when I was around 18 years old. The best I can recall was that it was around 1979. So I thought I would go ahead and report it just incase someone else has also reported this. I have told several people about this but most just think I'm crazy but I know what I saw. It was a very cold winter morning (maybe December 1979 or January 1980), I lived on a farm. We had a long driveway and the mail box was at the end of the driverway. Just west of the mail box was a long shelterbelt with lots of trees. I went down to get the mail and pulled up to the mail box in my pickup when something caught my eye walking in the field so I pulled up to see better. What I saw was a large man like thing walking south in the field toward the sherlterbelt. It was approx. 1/4 mile west of me and approx. 10 to 20 yards north of the shelterbelt. I saw it for about 10 to 12 seconds is all. I remember it being dark brown with long hair. The wind was blowing fairly hard out of the north and I remember seeing the hair on it's arms and face blowing toward the front of it because the wind was at it's back. I also remember it having long arms and it took big steps. It kind of turned it's head and looked a little toward me and then walked a little faster and disappeared in the trees. I know it wasn't a man because no one would have been walking out there on such a cold morning. I had a high power rifle with a scope in my pickup but didn't have time to even pick it up and look through the scope at it. I wanted to go out there and look for tracks but I was afraid to. There was snow on the gound maybe about a foot worth. This field was a paster that it was walking in. The shelterbelt consisted of large old cottonwood trees and some pine trees. Well that's about it.",
