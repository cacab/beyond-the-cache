  "observed": "My friend and me were talking loudly (for hunting) and did not recognize where we were. When we heard two or three loud screams that sounded like a sick cow, but alot higher pitch and longer in length. We were stunned and infact took cover behind a log. It seemed as it was coming twards us. Very loud branches breaking and thumping. But just like that, it stopped and we high-tailed it out of there.",
