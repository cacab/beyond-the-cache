Undetermined age of tracks, but believed to be fairly recent (within last 48 hours) due to lack of degradation of track edges. Plaster cast (single) taken of largest. Cast condition is poor, due to reporting parties lack of familiarity with casting technique. Cast was taken within 24 hours of track discovery.",
