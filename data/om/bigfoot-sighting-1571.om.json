  "observed": "7pm, driving from Nelson, BC to Spokane WA, myself & my girlfriend were driving a few miles outside Ione. At the same time, we both noticed something on the highway. We had to stop the car very quickly to avoid hitting it. It was quite small....maybe 5'2\", 150lbs, standing on two legs, covered with hair. We have no idea what it was, but was unusual. We both had a really good look at the thing, although only a second or two long, the headlights were directly shining on it. My girlfriend was driving and as I saw this thing on the road, I said, \"look out for that....that.....that...that....mugwamp\". Refering to the bigfoot in our local beer ads. I yelled stop...stop & she said no way and drove off.",
