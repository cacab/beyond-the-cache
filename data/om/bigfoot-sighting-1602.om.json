  "observed": "There were two of us and a dog. We had the dog tied up to a nearby tree so he would not pick up a scent of a deer or bear and track it (hound dog). It was the second weekend of june 1995 and it remained daylight at that time of year and in that area until just after 10:00. At about 8:45, we had a fire going and had already eaten. We were sitting and enjoying being where we were. There was some movement in the bushes so we both looked up to see a doe staring at us. She must not have seen or smelled us until she got relatively close. We kept the dog busy with food scraps as she ran away so he would not start howling. Everything returned to normal. At about 9:00 we heard a rhythmic sound stepping on leaves and small twigs. We both looked up and saw across the ravine from us about 30 yards away, two large legs walking along a path on the upward slope. The legs were covered with very black and long hair and had a definite bend where a knee would be located. I held the dog and the other person walked into the ravine to see if he could see the object up close. He saw the animal's legs step up to climb higher up the slope. As it did he could see it step over a large fallen log. Because of the position were were in and the thickness of the trees it was impossible to see the entire figure. At that moment all movement stopped and it became silent. We knew we were being watched from a safe location... we packed our tent quickly and knew we could not make the descent to the paved road at night and then another 35 to 40 miles to the nearest town. We moved as close as possible to a large group of loud drinking campers on the other side of the campground.. at three in the morning we were both awakened by the heavy pounding on the ground near our re-pitched tent. It sounded like, when you are running fast and stop suddenly then we heard three high shrill screams from 20 yards? away. It sounded like a crow with a voice.",
