  "observed": "I was camping with my family around Taylor resivor, towards Aspen in a Coleman pop-up camper.Around midnight I heard something moving or licking our cast iron skillet that was washed and left by a tree outside our camper. I got up and opened the door of our camper expecting to see a bear. At that time my friends dogs that were sleeping in his tent about 100 feet from our camper strated to bark. In the distance I saw a large dark object running into the woods. The suprising thing was that our camper started to shake rapidly. In the morning I asked my wife if she could feel the camper if I ran by it. I weigh 220 lbs and couldn't make it move at all. When this animal ran away from it it felt like an earthquake. Very Strange.",
