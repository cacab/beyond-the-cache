  "observed": "I was out on the small lake fishing with a friend and we heard something big running through the water by the shore. It was not a deer or elk as it was running fast and heavy through the water. The ducks and heron in the water flew off and then everything was dead silent.  When we turned the boat around, to go back to shore on the other side of the lake, I looked back into the inlet where we heard the running. I could make out something very big on two feet standing in the shadows of the trees. It was standing up and it was swaying from side to side. I tried to watch it for a while before my friend made us go back. Also my house is not far from the lake and almost every night between 1a.m. and 3a.m. I hear this roaring sound that is not any animal I ever heard and once in a while something answers back.",
