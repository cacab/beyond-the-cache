We where camping in the woods near my house after a day of playing paintball capture the flag. Me and my friend Justin were one team and the other was Greg and Jason . Me and Justin had been sleeping at our camp when I heard a sound. I looked up to see if it was Jason and Greg come to get us. When I looked I saw a figure leaning out of the tree line. It was maybe 100 yards away. After that the crashing noises got louder. Me and Justin got scared and went to find Jason and Greg. When we found them they said that they had herd it to. At light we headed back to our camp. As we were getting our stuff we heard a scream. It sounded like OOORREEEE! We ran all the way home and have not been back.",
