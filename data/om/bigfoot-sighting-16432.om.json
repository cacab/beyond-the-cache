  "observed": "[Editors note regarding classification of this report: This report is  Class B for two reasons:  1) It was not written by the actual witness, and 2) the figure was distant -- 300-400 yards.] I am writing this on behalf of my father-in-law.  On October 29, 2006 he, his wife, and a friend were hiking on the lookout trail in Chadron State Park.  Walking east, they came to a place where the trail takes a sharp turn to the south.  As they rounded the turn, my father-in-lawâ€™s friend looked towards the north and noticed someone, or something, standing on top of a limestone ridge about 300 to 400 yards away.  He stopped my father-in-law (my mother-in-law was walking a bit ahead of the two of them) and pointed the figure out to him.  Even from that distance, they could tell that there were some unusual features about the figure.  It was unusually tall and covered from head to toe in black fur.  They watched it for five minutes as it stood on the ridge and swayed back and forth before it casually walked behind a limestone outcrop and disappeared into the pine forest. They have no idea what this creature is that they witnessed.  The only reasonable explanation we could come up with is that since it is so close to Halloween, someone was running around in the forest in a gorilla costume.  But the area is extremely remote (a combination of national forest land and Nebraska state park land) and this explanation, though plausible, is highly unlikely.",
