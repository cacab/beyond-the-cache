  "observed": "This happened in summer sometime between 1980-82 approximate. My then husband and I liked to hike. We lived in Lake George,N.Y. and were aware of the rangers road up the back of Prospect Mtn. We foolishly figured it wuld be an hour up and and hour back and we'd be home by supper and didn't take a flashlight. It took 2 hours up and the sun was beginning to wane. Now my husband had a habit of walking very fast sometimes out of my sight and I kept yelling, almost crying,\" Wait ,wait for me!\"As it got near dusk, the road was darker and darker and I finally grabbed and held on to his arm so I wouldn't be left alone and behind. Then we heard something big crunching up the ground just off the road in the woods beside us and following along with us.If we stopped, it stopped. I couldn't tell if it was one or more but I think just one. aAll down the Mtn until we got to where the road kind of levels out for at least an hour or more that thing was in the woods following.He figured it was deer or a bear but would those animals do that? Then recently when I read that teens on the bike trail near French Mtn thought they saw something in 81 or 82 or 83 I began to wonder. The bike trail goes a long ways following route 9 right into Lake George and Prospect Mtn is on the other side of rt 9 not many miles away.",
