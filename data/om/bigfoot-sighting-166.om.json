  "observed": "I dont think this was a BIGFOOT sighting, and in fact never even considered it until stumbling across your site, and reading a few things that were similiar to what we heard. But I thought I would share, if only for the sake of adding to your information base. I had a friend visiting, and we were both awaked around 2:00-3:00AM, by a very un-natural howling sound.  It sounded as if a pack of wild dogs was running past the house.  We didnt hear any footsteps though, just a very odd sounding howling.  But it was like a mixture of howling and heavy wind combined.  Note, it wasnt windy that night at all.  We heard it for about 10 seconds, as it went past the house and kept going.  We could heard the sounds fade in the distance as it ran off.  We both sat there terrified, saying \"What the #$%$# was that??\"  We didnt go outside to check it out, rationalizing that it had to be a pack of dogs, or coyotes or something.  Until reading your site, I hadnt really thought much more of it.",
