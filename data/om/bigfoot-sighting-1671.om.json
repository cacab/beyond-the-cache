  "observed": "My sister was on her way to work, driving north on hwy 9 between Marysville & Arlington going to work. This must have been around 5:00 am. I would need to talk to her again to confirm. It took her several years to tell anybody & I think I am the only one she told. It happened about 15-20 yrs ago. Again I would have to contact her to confirm. She noticed something large in the middle of the road. At first she thought it was a bear. Then as she got closer it stood up. It was huge. She said it took only 2 steps & it was off the hwy. & into the woods. She was scared to death. She knew it was a bigfoot.",
