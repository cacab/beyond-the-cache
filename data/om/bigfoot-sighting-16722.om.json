  "observed": "I was just about to go to bed for the night when I took my dog outside for a quick walk. The area around my house is very densely wooded and my backyard is so forested that it's hard to see in the dark more than maybe 20 feet in. As I was about to head back inside I heard what sounded like a person walking through the brush about 80 yards out. Because of the time, I was curious as to who was walking in my backyard and decided to stay silent and observe rather than calling out. After a few moments of silence there was continued wrestling in the trees and what sounded like the snapping and breaking of branches. My dog started a low growl and the movement in the trees stopped. A few seconds later, there was a deep, loud growl in the trees. I told my dog to be quiet, but she barked at the noises causing the creature in the trees to start a progressive scream which at its peak was so loud I am sure it was not human. I went back inside immediately, but my dog continued to growl at the noises for quite some time. I didn't have a view of the yard from my room because of a stairway in the way, but I continued to hear the creature vocalizing over the next ten minutes. I've heard the screams of mountain lions before, but never anything like this.",
