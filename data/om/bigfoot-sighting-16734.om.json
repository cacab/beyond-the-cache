  "observed": "I was travelling down Hwy 402 in Berkeley County going to load some steel at a steel plant. It was just before dark and I saw something ahead on all fours crossing the road. At first I though it was a horse. Then a bear. It did not have a natural gait and the body was too thin to be a horse and it was too tall to be a bear.  As I closed up on it I saw that it had dark brown hair that was several inches long. The head was smaller than a horse or a bear. I believe it to be a bigfoot on all fours. I had slowed down and stopped where I thought it had gone into the woods. It was very thick at this point.  Standing, it would probably be 9 feet tall from my opinion.",
