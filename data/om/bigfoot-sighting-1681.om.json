  "observed": "I will break these down into the three events, divided by the types of events.  The first two are from hearing screams at night.  The third is a brief sighting. My friend and I had just gone to bed (well, I was in a bed. He was in a sleeping bag). We had just turned out the lights and were talking when we heard a five second scream from the hillside, just Northeast of the house. Having heard the scream so many years before, and in bigfoot documentaries, I recognized the origin. After pausing while the hairs on the back of our necks stood up, I said, \"You know what the F--K THAT was don't you?\" We didn't hear any further screams that night. I spent a lot f time in this area and know what the various night animals sound like. This was no cougar and certainly not a coyote. It was very much like the latter half of a roaring scream that I have heard played on various bigfoot documentaries. It was loud, powerful and can only be described as \"wild\" in the way it carried on. Though brief, it made an impression.",
