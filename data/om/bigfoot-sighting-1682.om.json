  "observed": "I will break these down into the three events, divided by the types of events.  The first two are from hearing screams at night. The third is a brief sighting. I was at the edge of a field, about a mile down the road from my grandparents' house.  I had ridden my motorcycle down to a small pond by the edge of the road, where I was looking to see if I could find any frogs or salamanders.  I was walking slowly around the pond again and again.  I heard a loud cracking sound coming from the treeline on the other side of the field, about 100 yards away.  I turned to see, very quickly, a very large dark brown shaggy form tearing-down a branch as it turned and almost instantly disappeared into the treeline.  The creature I saw was on the other side of a mound, so I could not see it's legs, but it looked to be around seven feet tall.  I had a strange feeling of being watched.  However, I did not have the sense of being threatened, though I did get the feeling that it wanted me to know it was there, as it was likely watching me for sometime before breaking down the branch.  I decided to get on my motorcycle and head for the house.",
