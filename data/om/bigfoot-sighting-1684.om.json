  "observed": "My wife and I decided to go camping in the area, even though some of the Indian loggers told us not to, because the area was known to be the haunt of the local tribe of Sasquatch. By the way, we had been staying in the general area for a few months and had heard Sasquatch whistles and howls each night. I used to be a trapper in Montana, and knew exactly what mountain lions and other wild animals sounded like. These sounds had an eerie edge to them. Anyway, we hiked into the area about three miles from the road, and made camp by a stream. Everything was peaceful enough. But sure enough, once it got dark and we got in the tent, we started to smell the most awful stench, like rotting garbage, or a wet dog, but worse. Then we heard grunting and hooting noises, and stomping going on around us. I finally got the nerve to get out of the tent and shine the flashlight around, but couldn't see anything. As soon as I got back inside, the noise, the smell and the sounds continued. In fact, they seemed to be building themselves up to a fever pitch, and the sounds started to surround the tent. We finally could take no more, and on the count of three, got up and ran in the dark all the way back (three miles) to the road, where we slept against a tree. In the morning we went back, and most of our stuff was intact. There were scuffle marks all over the dry dirt, but nothing conclusive. When we told our indian friends about it, they looked at us like we were crazy for ever going in there. \"We told you that is their territory!\" they exclaimed. They said they had been there forever, and everyone knew not to bug them. We never went in at night again, but we could still hear their calls often in the evening. Naturally, most people assumed our friends were playing a trick on us, but they all seemed to be in agreement about the Sasquatch, whether they were people we knew or not.",
