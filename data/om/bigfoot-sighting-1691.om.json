  "observed": "I had just moved to an area called Green Bluff Northeast of Spokane with my Grandparents. I was 14 years old at the time and was fascinated with the area having moved there from Louisiana. Mount Spokane can be seen on a clear day from where we lived and I asked my Grandparents permission to hike up the mountian some weekend. I was told NO due to the distance and the winter conditions. The next weekend I walked up the \"Day Road\" that led me to the top of Mount Kit Carson. I could see the top of Mount Spokane from the peek of Mt. Kit Carson and it looked increbibly close. Thinking no one would know I decided to hike to the top of the mountian. It was snowing very hard and I was cutting a fresh trail waist deep as I hiked above the timber line toward the top of the mountian. After reaching the summit I decided I better follow my tracks back so I didn't get lost in the storm. About 300 feet above the timber line I discovered tracks leading away from mine going on around the mountian. Something with HUGE feet  had followed me from the  timber line part way up the mountian. The tracks looked like bear feet but were very big and it was obvious the (thing) was walking on it's hind feet. I had never heard of Big Foot so could only think it was a huge bear. Then other thoughts came to mind! It's the middle of winter -- shouldn't bears be hibernating? He must have gotten hungry!! I ran down the mountian as fast as I could in the deep snow and soon saw when the (thing) had found my tracks and started following me. It looked like the (thing) had been walking on it's hind feet the whole time and had stayed just below the timber line until it found my tracks. It didn't take me long to get off the mountian and back home. I couldn't tell anyone what had happened as I would have been in trouble for going up there. I've told a few friends about this over the years and most doubt  that it would be a bear that high up in the middle of the winter.",
