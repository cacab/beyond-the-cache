  "observed": "I was on the side of a hill with three bench flats. I was on the middle flat in my tree climber.   I was hunting by myself and heard two knocks on a tree to the west about almost to the hill top.  After about 45 seconds I heard another knock on a tree low, behind me.  I did not see anything or hear anything else.  I reported this before but called the tree knocks Bonks.   Also while hunting near Kimbrough, AL I heard one tree knock again. This was about 15:30 or 16:00 while I was in my tree climber.",
