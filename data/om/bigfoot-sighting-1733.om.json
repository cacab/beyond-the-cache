  "observed": " OBSERVED: About 1998, I don't remember the month, but it was cool and at night.  I'd written the incident down, but I can't find it right now.  Anyway, we were driving on Baseline Rd., between 51 Ave. & 67 Ave. going west.  Myself, my wife, and nephew, saw maybe two cars swerve around in the road ahead. As we approached, I slowed down, and then a creature stepped across half the road in front of us and into and across a small canal and onto a golf course. By then I had turned my scout around deciding to use 51 Ave. instead of using 67 Ave.  I asked every one what they saw and their response was, bigfoot, except for my wife who just wanted out of the area.  As far as the description, it was big and tall with dark matted stringy hair.  I could not see its face very well, because I was too busy turning the scout around. The creature didn't seem to care if we were there, it just stepped across the road ignoring the cars.  There is very little traffic in this area at night.",
