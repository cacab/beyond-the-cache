  "observed": "On Jan.18, 2007 at about 17:35 my wife and I decided to go out into the woods looking for deer and enjoying the snow in our 4 wd truck. We were driving along and we decided to take a DNR access road. Nothing unusual was noticed as we drove along down to the lake other than the the lack of deer tracks that normaly criss cross the area. There had been a recent snow and the area around the lake was for the most part lacking any signs of movement except for a single set of  tracks  leading up from a bowl like depression and passing by the toilet building.  My wife pointed to them and asked me what kind of animal would make that track, when I looked over I noticed that the tracks were that of  something walking upright on two legs.  I stopped the truck and got out to look closer the snow depth is around 18 to 20 inches.  The length between the strides I would estimate to be between 45 to 50 inches the interesting thing was that the tracks were clean in that there were no drag marks  just a clean stride.  When I went to examine them there were a lot of drag mars left by me  and a few slips in the deep snow, my stride fell short by some 20 or so inches as I tried to match the stride.  I was unable to determine if there were any toe prints but the prints looked a bit irregular at the front of them.  The single set of tracks  continued up a trail and into a stand of pines.  I have no idea how long the tracks were there but the snow had only fallen the night before. I just wanted to get this down while it was fresh in my mind.",
