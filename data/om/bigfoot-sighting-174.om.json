  "observed": "I was having a dream that I was being watched. My ex and I had thrown our mattress in the back of our truck, which sat about 1.5 feet lower than the canopy windows. The dream I had frightened me, because the face I was seeing was not human. I woke up in a sweat and happened to be facing the window in the canopy in time to see a large dark form moving away from the window, toward the front of the truck and out of my view. I sat up and cautiously peeked out of the canopy window to see this VERY LARGE,dark, hairy figure moving quickly up the hill into the forest from the campground. It walked upright with the gait of a human, it moved through the trees giving me an estimate of it's height at about 7ft. I remember loosing my scientific detachment at that time and as the \"thing\" disappeared further up the hill, I shook my ex awake and through a choked and somewhat hysterical description explained that I was very frightened. I couldn't calm down, and he decided it would be a good idea to leave. We quickly got out of the back of the truck and noticed a very dank and musky smell. This scared me even further and we loaded our things and drove out of the camp. I wish I had been in a better frame of mind during the event, however the memory of the face I had seen, apparently in the half awake state( and still see in my mind) was not condusive to rational thinking. It was vaguely humanoid with large protruding brows, the eyes were dark and intense. The nose was a strange mixture of gorilla and human. The mouth was severe and somewhat turned down with fleshy lips. The facial hair was not on nose, eyes or mouth. The head was conical shaped, with a pronounced saggital crest. The jaw was not prognathic. Frankly, it scared the s*** out of me. I must state that I am a student of anthropology at Portland State University, and have never (outside of immediate family members) discussed this with my colleagues. I have always been fascinated with the \"legends\"  but perhaps I never believed them truly until that moment. My family is amused by my story but think perhaps I just had a bad dream. Doubt it.",
