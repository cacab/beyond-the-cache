  "observed": "I was on my way to work on a Monday morning. I had to leave a little early because of the snow and fog. I was leaving from near the Mt. Graham foothills headed towards Safford traveling about 15 mph. The fog was so heavy I could bearly see. I flipped my brights on to try and see better but it only made it worse.  when i turned them off I saw a hairy man like creature run across the road. It had to be at least 7ft. tall. I couldn't get a good look at it beacuse it vanished into the fog.  I know for certain it wasn't a human.",
