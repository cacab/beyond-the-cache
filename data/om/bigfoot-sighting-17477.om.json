  "observed": "I was playing paint ball with my son, and some kids he was freinds with, about summertime 2003. I had taken the youngest child(about 6) with me, and the other kids(mostly late teens) were looking for us. We were hiding in an overgrown ditch near our home, in a fairly populus, rural area. We both heard a strange groaning noise coming from the direction of some nearby appartments. The little boy I was with, was quite afraid, and wanted to go inside. I scared him so bad, he was crying. We went inside, and I told my wife, the boys mother, and the other kids about the sound. We all went into the yard, and heard the groans. I just listened to the Mississippi groans, and that was what i heard. I also checked to see if there was anymore sightings in my area, and I am about 25 miles from the Lanier county Georgia sighting.",
