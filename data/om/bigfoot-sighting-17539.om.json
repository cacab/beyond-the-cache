  "observed": "On February 2nd, I went outside to get some stuff out of the truck and was listening to the night sounds.  The night was clear and cool and there had not been any rain for about a week.  So it was pretty dry.  I breathed in through my nose to smell the fresh air and to my surprise the smell I got was of wet fur with a sickly sweet smell to it.  It was almost to the point of being nauseating.  I looked around for the source of the smell.  I could not find it.  It was about 8:00 P.M.  I went back inside the house and tried to think of what it could have been. About 11:30 P.M. February 3rd, I stepped out of the house.  There were many dogs barking throughout the area and I wondered what all the comotion was all about.  It was clear and no wind.  As I listened, I could hear the dogs at the farms down stream beging to bark.  Then at each consecutive farm, coming up stream, the dogs would start to bark.  About a quarter mile from the where I was standing, I heard the neighbor's dog start to bark.  There was a lot of noise in orchard and the neighbors trying to get their dog to come back.  It finally quieted down, then I heard what sounded like a long call, an eerie call, kind of high pitched.  It was followed up by a second call across the river.  There was a five to six second delay between the calls.  The call sent shivers up my spine.  I am an advid hiker, have been a hunter and have spent the majority of my spare time in the mountains and I had never heard a call like this one.  I immediately went back inside. February 4th,  I was up late that night.  I could not sleep.  All sorts of things going through my head.  I wondered what I had heard and smelled the past couple of days.  Thought that I may have just imagined the whole thing.  I decided to step outside and listen again.  Down by the river, I heard a strange noise.  It was like someone taking a big rock and hitting a tree.  It sounded like \"bam, bam, bam, bam, pause, bam.\"  Thought it was kind of strange to hear that.  A few seconds later, in the distance I heard another knocking of \"bam, bam, bam, pause, bam.\"  I then went inside to check out this site.  I sent a comment/question out to see what your researchers would say.  They emailed me back to see if I had heard a fox.  I went through all the sounds of the foxes, then went back to the sight and heard the noise again.  This time it most matched the \"1978 Whoop-Howl from Snohomish County, Washington\".  I spoke to a few people around here and they have stated that there is activity in this area.  Last night was quiet and there were no sounds.",
