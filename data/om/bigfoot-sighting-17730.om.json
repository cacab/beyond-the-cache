  "observed": "My ex-wife and I were driving on highway 94 in Carroll county, VA about 3-4 miles from the Wythe county line. We were returning from a Christmas shopping night in West Virginia. It was around midnight. I was driving and she was in the passenger seat talking away as usual, when all of a sudden we came upon something standing upright in a field off to the left. I slowed to a stop and asked my ex what the hell is that? She couldn't say a word. We observed the thing for about 10 minutes from the side of the road. I am a deer hunter and used a spotlight to help illuminate the moonless night. The thing was at least 8 foot tall and had to top 500lbs. We never talked about this to anyone for fear of being called crazy. This is the first time i have ever breathed a word about it. I heard of other sightings in this area but had never encountered it until that night.",
