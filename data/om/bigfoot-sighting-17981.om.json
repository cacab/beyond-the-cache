  "observed": "Hello, I am from Koppel Pa, Beaver County. I have miles and miles of strip mines and mushroom mines all around my house. [Editor's Note: \"Mushroom mines\" are underground coal mines that were converted into subterranean farms for growing mushrooms. Mushrooms grew very well in these tunnels because the air temperature and humidity remained very stable and consistent throughout the seasons. Modern methods for stabilizing air temperature and humidity have made mushroom mines mostly obsolete, so most of these tunnels have been abandoned]. I was in the strip mines by the Wampum mushroom mines and heard a loud groaning sound. We (my buddy and I) went to make sure no one was hurt and we saw a large framed figure all a dirty brown color. I, thinking it was a brown bear, yelled very loud to spook it and make it run, but the large figure turned and looked us in the eyes and ran. I never believed in \"Bigfoot\" but this is hard to ignore. It stood about 6' plus. Very thick build kind of like a heavy weight boxer. The hair was medium in length, dirty brown. (closley resembled to a brown bear). The figure was not very threatenig but instead just ran off into the mines. We looked for it for about an hour or so but didn't see it again.",
