  "observed": "My wife and I were out driving around checking out the countryside and came across this park. We got out to take a walk and enjoy the weather and the woods. We decided to walk the foot path. I started to take pictures of the lake and the trees. When we started down the path I noticed some tracks crossing the path. I told my wife to come look. The foot prints came from the lake across the path and in to the woods. I told her these look like bigfoot prints so I took some photos of them. When I think back it was real quiet and it felt like somebody was watching us.",
