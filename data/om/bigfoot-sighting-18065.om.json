  "observed": "A couple of years ago, my best friend at the time and I were just hiking through the woods like we typically did back then. We weren't making a lot of noise, but we were joking around as usual and laughing a little bit, and not really paying attention to our surroundings. We were originally planning on visiting a spot where several large, thick blue berry bushes grew to pick some of the berries, until we rounded a corner to the right in the trail. Approximately forty or fifty yards away, I noticed a loomering figure. It was tall, black, and had thick fur that appeared to be semi-long and coarse. It wasn't facing us and due to the height of the bushes and palmettos, a lower half the body wasn't visible to our eyes. My guess at it's height is somewhere between six and seven feet tall at the top of its head. The creature was moving away from us and though I don't recollect any noise ( I'm assuming I was far too frightening to remember it, because only seconds after seeing it, we ran ), but my best friend, who was standing directly at my side, claims she heard it moving through the foliage and creating quite a bit of sound such as breaking twigs, branches, and leaves rustling. We were genuinely freaked out and ran from the area as soon as we managed to regain ourselves and our bearings, which couldn't have been any longer than thirty seconds or so.",
