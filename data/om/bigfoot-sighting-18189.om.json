Hence, this is not a second-hand report (only first-hand reports are allowed in the BFRO database, with very limited exceptions). Original submission: I didn't have the encounter myself. But I know a guy who swears up and down that he's seen this creature twice in the Spring Canyon area near Helper Utah. His Brother-In-Law witnessed it as well. Him and his Brother-In-Law were in back of a truck road hunting for deer. As they were driving along slowly they seen the creature move quickly across a meadow into a bunch of pines. They started to pound on top of the cab of the truck to get the attention of the person who was driving. The event happened so quickly that nobody else got a chance to see it. They described it being dark in color with long arms that swung way out as it moved. They said it didn't run, just walked really fast. They thought the strides could have been 4 to 5 ft. and covered approximately a 40 ft. meadow within seconds. I've recently talked to the Brother-In-Law the other day and brought up the incident. He still stands by what he had seen that day. He told me that it definetly wasn't a bear. My friend and his Brother-In-Law are very much down to earth. I've heard a few more bigfoot related incidents but I think this had more detail than the others. I just wanted to let you know that Carbon Cnty has had it's share of bigfoot sightings as well.  Thanks ---------------------------- Notes from Investigators Interview with one of the Witnesses: This interview took place on February 24, 2008. The first sighting happened many years ago, when the witness was between twelve and thirteen years old. He was in a canyon near a small town in Carbon County, Utah. He was with his cousin, a girl about nine or ten years old, giving her a ride on a motorcycle. As they were riding up an old railroad bed the witness saw what he thought was a person running up the side of the mountain. He wondered “what idiot would jog up a hill”. The person kept going up and up and was “as tall as the damn cedar trees”. When the witness realized the relative size of the figure he was watching, he stopped the motorcycle and shut it off.  At this time his cousin started crying and saying “let’s go, let’s go, let’s go”. The creature went through a narrow cut in the hillside. The spot could have been where a power line had been put through, or possibly a pipeline road. The second incident took place in the month of October, a year or two after the first incident. The witness was with his sister and her husband (the brother-in-law mentioned above), and an uncle and aunt. They were driving around looking for deer, in a fork of the same canyon where the previous sighting had taken place, but much further up the canyon this time. They were \"road hunting\", with the witness and the brother-in-law in the back of a pickup truck and the others in the front. As the two in the back of the truck were looking for deer they both saw a bigfoot walking from the top of a bald, grassy ridge into some pine trees. It walked at “a pretty good jaunt” across the hillside into the pines with its arms swinging. The two young men banged on the roof of the cab to make the driver stop. One of the people in the cab yelled “Where is it?” – thinking they had spotted a deer. The witness’ brother-in-law informed them that it was a bigfoot.",
