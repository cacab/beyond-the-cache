  "observed": "I was around seven years old when this happened. I have never forgotten what I saw! My sister and I have talk bout it a lot, but I have not talked to outsiders in fear of being labeled crazy, or being laughed at. It was in the fall of the year, late September 1967. My father raised tobacco in the small community called churchland, one of the many small townships in Davidson County. At that time we were renting an old homestead owned by a lawyer, who is now deceased. We lived out in the sticks, right next to the Yadkin River, which separates Davidson County from Davie County. My father was on the tractor coming from the tobacco field that evening, my older sister and some friends where on the back on the trailer that was used to haul tobacco from the field. It was dusk my father had just turned on the tractor lights. I was setting on his lap. We were almost to our tobacco barn when this huge thing stepped out in front of the tractor into the lights. It stopped right in front of us, turned toward us and paused. The face resembled a man, much lighter than the rest of him, but his body was covered in dark hair. It was taller that my dad who was around six foot and it was a lot bigger than him. Its arms were dropped past its waist. It acted like we were no threat, and turned and took a big step and it was in the woods. My dad put the brakes on, left the tractor running, left me sitting in the driver's seat and jumped off to follow it. I started crying, because I didn’t know what it was.  I even thought at that time it was the booger man that would get you if you were not good. That is what my parent’s would tell us kids. My father came back, not saying a word and took us kids back to the house. He told my mom not to let us out. He then took his coon hunting gun and left to hunt it down. He later returned that night. He could not find the thing we saw. We had to stay in the front yard after that. We later moved to a farm that my dad had purchased a few miles away from this one, still the Yadkin River, flowed right next to our farm. For years I wondered what the heck it was that we saw. Years later in the late seventies, more and more was on TV about what is now known as Bigfoot. I know without a doubt that this is what we saw that evening.",
