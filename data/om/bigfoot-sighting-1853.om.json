  "observed": "My youngest daughter was about 8 when it happened, so that must have been around 1972. We had just passed Kingman, Arizona travelling back to Oklahoma. My sister was with me and our children were asleep in the back. We were driving one of those VW \"Lovebug\" type vans, so when I say that what we saw was taller than our vehicle, I am saying it was taller than that VW van. It was dark, probably around 9 p.m. or later. We were not too far out of Kingman when this creature just suddenly appeared at the side of the rode from the shoulder area. It had its hand stretched out towards us. Maybe it was keeping our lights out of its eyes. It must have been 7 feet tall. It's eyes seemed aglow and they were manevolent. It moved so fast. We were surprised to see it, and even more surprised that it kept on crossing the road. I hadn't slowed down and before you could blink an eye it seemed like it was in the middle of the road and I had to swerve to miss it and in swerving, I braked a little. My sister screamed at me, \"Don't stop, don't stop. Just keep going.\" It had less hair on it's face than anywhere else. The hair on its arms was real long and it had hair everywhere else on its body. It seemed big and husky and it seemed like a man and at the same time it didn't. It seemed wild. It's hair was the color of like dark blonde. We didn't look back after we swerved. We were scared and we just got out of there!",
