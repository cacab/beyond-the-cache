  "observed": "I am not a very good writer. It would be better to talk to me but i'll do my best.  I was road hunting up by doty washington in the woods in an area that had been closed to motorist traffic for the last 3 yrs.  I drove to the end of the road in a small clearcut that had grown up a bit.  Saw nothing, no birds, no animals, no tracks, which i thought was weird, so i was looking down at the side of the road to look on the downhillside for tracks and i saw something black move real close.  Then this thing stood up and looked at me and i stopped the truck and froze. It was realy close like 15 feet on a downhill slope that was steep and this thing was almost at my level. it was very thick and very tall like over 8 feet tall and very broad across the shoulders.  It seemed as nervous as I was. it moved side to side and was moving its arms around.  I then said something like oh my god and then it blew its checks way up and muttered something wierd and i said something i can't remember. then it screamed very loud at me which made me scream if fear and then it turned and stepped up on a stump and jumped downhill. i floored the truck and went back to my son and his girlfriend about 1/2 to 3/4 mile away where i had left them to watch for deer. I was very scared and upset.  I waited to tell them but i was scaring them with how upset i was. so about an hour later i told them. Thats when they told me that they had heard a weird scream from the direction that i had come from.  My son wanted to go look for tracks and i said no but he finaly talked me into it.  So we went back to the spot and it was very dark by now. we stayed in the truck but had every thing off but the lights.  We all heard this thing throwing a fit. sounded like it was hitting things on a tree and throwing whatever sounded like swining a bat against a tree. then we heard it muttering what i can best descibe as mumbled bad japanese. i know its not just using an example to describe the sound, but no yell this time during the muttering. my son's girfriend got realy scared and i was too. so we speeded off and left the area",
