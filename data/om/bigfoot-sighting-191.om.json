  "observed": "This is a partial secondary report. I accidently sent the previous report before I completed the questionnaire. Bigfoot crossed the road in front of us while we were on Hwy 6 Between I-5 and the coast.  When we approched the crossing area it was grown up solid to the edge of the road. We were several hundred yards approching the figure when it was noticed. When we got closer there was no sign of it and the foilage looked impassable where it was. I am sure it was not a hiker or hunter. The figure moved with a purposeful gait. I would estimate the figure was in excess of 6 feet tall and had no distinguishable clothing.",
