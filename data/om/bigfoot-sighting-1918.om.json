  "observed": "Last summer, my mother was awaken by the dogs who were barking really hard so she got up and went upstairs to check on the children. On her way back down she just happened to look out of the window and she saw this dark figure walking up the road. She couldn't see it that well because trees were blocking her view but the window was open so she heard it making deep grunting noises. All the dogs in the neighborhood were barking and crying. About a week before my mom seen it, my aunt was also awaken by the dogs and she looked out here window (upstairs) and saw it disappear into the trees behind her house. She lives just next door to us. A few weeks after my mom seen it, I saw it. I woke up about 3 o' clock a.m. and my bed is positioned in my room so that if I sit up, I can see directly out of my window. My room is also on the second floor so I sat up and I saw it walking up the road. My window was open and the odor it let out smelled like something dead or decaying. It was about 7 or 8 feet tall, it was black, it's head kind of had a point near the back, as it walked it seemed slightly hunched over and it naturally swung it's arms. it was about 8 ft from an orange street light so I could see it clearly. I watched it as it walked up the road and once it got past the trees I couldn't see it anymore so I ran downstairs to my mom and woke her up then she came up to my room and she sat on my bed with me then the dogs started barking back by my house so we just sat on my bed and looked out the window. In the ditch by the road, we see it's figure through the trees, it was playing with a can or something. It was scary. We hear a lot of stories from the people who have seen it. Our neighborhood isn't that big and it's only been there for about 10 to 15 years, plus it's in the mountains.",
