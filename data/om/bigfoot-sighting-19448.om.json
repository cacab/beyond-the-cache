  "observed": "My family and I were camping in Monache Meadows, on the north side of Monache Mountain. Sometime late on May 26 or early May 27, my wife and I were startled by loud, echoing whoops. The whooping came in groups of two, a few moments of silence and then another pair. It seemed fairly near, perhaps 100 to 200 yards south of us, toward the slope of the mountain. The whoops were intense and were soon joined by howling coyotes. A chase seemed to erupt and the sounds began retreating away from us. It was not clear whether the coyotes were giving chase or being chased. But as the uproar receded, it sounded as though something was being attacked, given a series of yelps and high-pitched howls. It sounded extremely violent. \"Whatever it was,\" my  wife said the next morning, \"it was being torn apart.\" After a minute or two, the chase faded into the distance. The normal sounds of night returned to the forest.",
