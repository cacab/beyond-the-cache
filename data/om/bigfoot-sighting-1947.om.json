  "observed": "I was sitting at camp and could smell the familiar smell of a bear so I started looking around the area.  I saw something move and at first I thought it was a man.  Then it stood up as if it had been eating something on the ground.  It paused then proceeded to walk calmley across the top of this ridge steadily becoming more clear to my sight. It came close enough that I could hear the twigs breaking under foot.  After it traveled aprox. 80-100 feet it the went down the backside of the ridge.  And NO it wasnt a bear!  It was much bigger.  Color was dark - almost black.",
