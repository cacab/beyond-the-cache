  "observed": "It was about 430 am and I had just settled into my treestand for a day of hunting.  It was extremely quiet which was the first thing that I noticed.  It was going on about 500 when I heard what sounded like a log being hit with another log.  I brushed it off as something going on up at the new construction site on top of the hill.  About 520 am I heard something walking back and to my left toward the top of the hill I was sitting on.  I was about 1/4 of the way up the hill and this was near the top where I heard it.  I knew the walking was bipedal and at this point in time I got very angry about somebody tresspassing and ruining my day of deer hunting. As the noise got closer the sun was just up enough I could skyline this huge \"man\" walking across the top of the ridge.  I looked at him through my binos and well it wasn't any man.  I know this bigfoot had to be 7' 5\" tall and at least 650 lbs.  He was dark brown or black in color unable to tell exactly due to lighting issues.  I wasn't able to make out facial features.  His hair was maybe 2 inches long and his hands were definitely below knee level.  I put my binos down and it was then he must have noticed something and within 3 strides he disappeared into the grapevine thicket.  The entire actual sighting lasted maybe 15 seconds.",
