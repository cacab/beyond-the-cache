  "observed": "I was driving home from Springfield, Mo to Eldorado Springs, Mo one evening about a month ago.  I noticed something in the road ahead of me on 32 HWY and at first I thought it was a bear. I have only seen one bear in my life but I thought it had been hit in the road.  When I got closer I realized it was moving near the side of the road, eating out of a trash bag in the ditch.  I honked my horn as I approached and thats when it stood up to run away.  It wasn't that big maybe 4 or 5 feet tall but it stood on its hind legs and ran off into the field. I stopped and backed my van up to see if I could see into the field with my head lights but didnt see anything.  I waited a while until a car came up behind me but never saw it again. It was dark haired like a bear and I really didnt see its face.  I havent told anyone this story for fear of getting laughed at.  I know what I saw was no bear.  We had a bear kill one of our goats about 6 months ago. I saw that one about 10 feet from me, so I know what they look like.",
