  "observed": "I was hunting on Badger mountain-5 miles south of Richland,Washington,in March, on a cool winter/sping day partly overcast/sunny day. And was looking through binoculars from its summit,when I noticed from the valley floor looking south, a large,Extremely hairy, 7.5 to 8 foot apelike creature,walking, then suddenly running at a pace that no human could match. I followed it for 4-5 minuted untill it disapeared into a a little ravine with a creek bed running through it. 5 years earlier in 1962,as a twelve year old, I had been hunting east of Richland,Washington, by the Delta of the Yakima River,where it empties into the mightly Columbia River. It was in the middle of the winter time, with the weather close to 5 degrees, and encountered massive footprints that were made in the snow I estimated at that time of the weight being between  500-1000 lbs. On looking back of my two encounters, I am a firm believer that not only does Bigfoot exsist, but he is useing all of our natural resourses to his advantage. for food, and shelter.",
