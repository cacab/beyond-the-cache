  "observed": "Today, March 18, 2001, my brother and I were hiking near Table Rock Wilderness in Clackamas County, Oregon. Found footprints in the snow very much like a very large, bare, human foot. We wear size 12 and 13 boots and the prints were significantly bigger. Using a dollar bill as a size reference I took pictures with a digital camera. Using the dollar bill we measured a stride of 4 feet. Also the prints were deeper than ours or the other human prints in the area. I would like to submit the pictures for expert evaluation and will do so if an e-mail address is provided.",
