  "observed": "someone should call me about this....i have a great deal of information to relate.....autumn night....weather was warm but very foggy....area was at my house which was in a glen near the kishwaukee river.  very dense forest area within a couple hundred yards.  figure DID NOT look like a big hairy ape.....very tall, slender and very large eyes...color appeared simialar to a local deer. was hiding behind tree watching me...i have extremely good hearing and night vision.  it made noise as i was getting into a car.  with the door of the car open i reached in and turned on the headlamps.  it was peeking around a tree....it froze in the light but recovered quickly.  we made eye contact which it held for several long seconds.  it then turned and ran...within 3 or 4 strides it was able to hurdle a 5-6 foot fencing without breaking stride.  i was able to watch it run for several hundred feet, although my vision was hampered by the fog.  at that time i worked from home in my garage often at night and had heard many odd things before and after.  contact me for further information...i believe this creature to still exist and i plan on looking for it this summer.  I would be pleased to talk your organization, however i would prefer not to have this sighting listed just yet.",
