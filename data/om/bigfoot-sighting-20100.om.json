  "observed": "I WAS WITH MY FRIEND RICK. HE WAS DRIVING US DOWN COUNTY RD SW IN WELLS TOWNSHIP, HEADING WEST TOWARDS  COUNTY RD 557. WE HAD BEEN MOVING ALONG SLOWLY TOWARD 557. I COULD SEE THE PAVEMENT AND THE SUN WAS SHINNING BRIGHT ON IT. THERE WERE SMALL TREES THAT HAD GROWN TALL ALONG THE ROAD BEFORE YOU GET TO THE PAVEMENT.THEY KIND OF TURNED IN TOWARDS THE ROAD AND CASTED A SHADOW ON THE ROAD. THE ROAD WAS WIDE ENOUGH FOR TWO VEHICLES TO PASS EACH OTHER IF YOU WENT SLOW. THE SUN LIGHT ON THE ROAD HAD ALL READY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WHEN I SAW A TALL, MUSCULAR, HAIRY,BROWN,HUMAN LOOKING THING WITH A BIG HEAD. IT CAME OUT FROM THE SMALL TREES BETWEEN US AND 557, THERE WAS ABOUT 200 YARDS BETWEEN US AND THE ROAD. THE THING WAS ABOUT HALF THAT DISTANCE. IT CROSSED THE ROAD IN ONE STEP! IT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT 9-10 FEET TALL! AT THE SAME TIME IT WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD RICK HAD SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES IN HIS PICK-UP TRUCK. WE DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT EACH OTHER AT FIRST, THEN HE STARTED MOVING FORWARD AND WE WERE BOTH A LITTLE SCARED .WE TRIED TO LOOK FOR TRACKS WHEN WE WENT BY THE PLACE WHERE IT CROSSED. BUT HE WOULD NOT STOP AT THE PLACE WHERE THE THING WALKED ACROSS.",
