  "observed": "I saw one of these sasquatch-bigfoot things one night walking on the side of the highway. I want to say it was in the early fall of 1980, because my kids were very young. My husband and I were driving up Hecker Pass from Watsonville, on our way to Mt Madonna to meet relatives for what I want to say was a dinner or dinner event. it seems so long ago. It happened very fast, but what I saw looked covered in brown hair from head to toe and was huge, walking just like a man. It scared me to death! My husband wasn't paying attention but he knew I saw something that frightened me terribly because I reacted emotionally so quickly. We were coming around a turn. I remember it being a very windy road, and it was walking with it's back to me. It was a very foresty area with lots of redwoods everywhere. It was so quick but so clear. I'm absolutely convinced of what I saw and still get shaken up when I think about it. I had great eyesight then and still have it now. I haven't talked about this with many people and am not sure who I told back then other than maybe my immediete family. It's been almost 30 years. Last week my husband and I were celebrating 4th of July at a party. I was stunned as I overhead Bart Cutino talking to my cousin about bigfoot as he was walking out the door.  I had no idea he looks for them and I haven't heard anything in the news in a long time. My eldest daughter used to babysit him when he was very young and I've known his mother my whole life. When I told him what I saw he convinced me to look at this site and report what happened.  I wish I could remember more. It's just been so long.",
