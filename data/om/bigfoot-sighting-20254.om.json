  "observed": "I  was hunting in area that is a isolated platou surrounded by canyons with roads in the bottom At the time you could drive  aways inthe area .Now it is closed except for summer use, The terrain is made of mahoganise, quakies,ceders sagebrush and pines. I had hiked about 3 miles from my truck circling the platous ridge dropping about 50' down below the  ridge into the tops of the canyons al the time I was bugleing for elk and calling for cyotes. I was useing my my hands to make sort of  adeep whistle type howl kind like blowing over the top of a bottle yet much louder and shriller. you can  do this by cupping your hands and blowing   across your thumbs.I did every so often  listening for a response. well in the distance I heard something so I copied it .I then heard another reponse .well what ever   it did ,I would respond, and so forth. Well the responses got closer and closer they were coming up the mountain to where I was. there were three of them as far as I could tell They stopped about 30yds below me  just in the trees and buckbrush they wouldnt come any closer, The hair on my  neck started to stand up,so I wasnt going down to  see what they were, so we cackeld back and forth about a half hour and I couldnt get them to come out and they wouldnt budge either, I was the One with 7mm in my hand  but I was alone and being 3miles from my truck I had no idea what they were at the time.and I wasnt going to find out, I decided to run for for it. Which I did for about a mile. there was nothing following me that could tell. That night I went to work telling  about the strangest thing,in which I described as the sound as a combination chimpanse a loon and coyote.I didnt relizes what I had happend until years later after I heard a clip of sound on the internet.",
