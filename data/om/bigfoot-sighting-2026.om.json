  "observed": "In May of '95, myself and 2 friends where nvited to go camping on Mt Hood, just below Timberline lodge. We had some friends who worked and the ski resort and they camped out in the woods right there at the resort. We had gotten there Firday afternoon. Saturday evening, sitting around the campfire, a strange sound came from the woods directly below us. My friend B., knowing we were avid outdoorsman, asked if we knew what kind of Animal was making the noise. We listened for a few minutes. The sound we heard was unlike ANYTHING I have EVER heard before. It was kind of like a Human scream/roar/laughter. It was definatly NOT a human. The Volume was too loud. B. said that they had heard it a few times before, they assumed it was a coyote. We laughed, saying that it wasn't a coyote. It wasn't a deer, elk, bear, coyote, fox, raccoon, human, owl, NOTHING!! This was all new to us. We listened for about 25 minutes as it circled our camp and then the sounds stopped. All the time, we could hear something LARGE walking through the brush. Well, we did kinda discuss it being Bigfoot, but jokingly. 3 days after getting home from camping, we were all 3 watching a program on Discovery Channel about Bigfoot. A guy( a Bigfoot researcher maybe??) had audio of Bigfoot just after seeing it. When he pushed play, WOW,. we were blown AWAY!! It was the EXACT same sound we had heard on Mt Hood!!! Not many people beleive us, but oh well. No drugs or alcohal was involved that nite either. And thats my Story!!!",
