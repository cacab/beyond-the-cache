  "observed": "This was October just after my birthday. It was getting chilly in the late afternoon. My friend and I were bored so we decided to go walking around in the woods adjacent to my home which was a one room school house my step dad was remodeling. We did these walks often, looking for cool places to build forts or just exploring. This time we went further back through an old apple orchard and thats when it happened.  As we were walking we both noticed it was really quiet.  No sounds of birds or animals. Nothing at all. We were a little amazed at the silence. Then the wind picked up a little, which blew the leaves around. There were still a lot on the trees. The leaves blowing broke the silence, so we started to move on. I had this weird feeling of being watched. I told my friend. He said he had it too. At that moment we both heard this loud thumping crunch. I said, \"Did you here that!?\" He nodded yes, afraid to talk because it was loud and close, robably 50ft away. It was like something had stomped the ground. I said it sounded like it came from over there, turning to the direction of the noise, we both saw this big upright animal covered in hair. It immediately moved into the deep brush and trees while making this deep kind of throated noise like \"Ugh!\" All we could see was the back 3/4 the way up the stomach, the butt and the left leg going into the brush. It wasn't crouching. It was upright, like it was just walking by. I started running, not thinking of my friend. I ran as fast as I could to my house which was about a  350 ft away, through dense brush, partial swamp and a trail. When I stopped my friend was right there, which surprised me, because I thought I could run faster than him. This thing's leg was at least as tall as me.  I was about 5'4 at 14 years old. It was dark reddish with some grey in it about 3-4 inches long. The fur was super thick. It's leg was thicker than my body. Out of the blue my friend recently visited me. We haven't seen each other since high school and we're both in our forties now. The second thing he asked was do ya remember what we saw behind your house.  I told him yeah we saw a dam bigfoot, and I don't think I have ever run so fast or strong since, not even when I was in the marines. Since then I have been always watchful for these critters.",
