  "observed": "It was the winter of 1996 and we were on our way home from church one Sunday evening. It wasn't dark yet. As we came around a corner we watched what we believe to be a bigfoot cross the road. As it came to a barb wired fence it stepped over it without missing a beat. It was like the fence wasn't even there. The fences in this area range from 3 1/2 feet to 4 foot tall. It was tall, dark in color and walked up right. There have been other sightings because our river bottoms were turned into a major lake project. Years ago I had heard the scream of the bigfoot which is something you don't forget.",
