  "observed": "There were actually several incidents that took place when my family resided in this particular location. I will try to hit on a few here. One night my mother, my grandmother and I heard a loud bang on the back of house which shook the house. When we went to check it out, we saw a large figure pass by the dining room window. This window was rather high off the ground. I was about 10 or 11 at the time and I could not even reach the bottom of this window. But whatever it was covered the entired window from top to bottom and side to side as it passed over it. So it had to be tall and rather large. It was dark in color and appeared to be covered with hair. My grandmother got her gun and we spent most of that night without sleep. On another night, in the early fall, I was in bed with the window open above my bed. My mother was in the bathroom right next to my room in the shower with the window beside her also open. At the same time we heard something walking in the leaves in our yard just outside. She ran from the bathroom to my room. I had heard this thing walking and breaking sticks as it approached. I could also hear it breathing. I had the impression it was quite large from the sound of the breathing which was heavy. It made a slight deep moaning sound as it breathed. I was paralyzed with fear and I could not look out my window, I could not even get out of bed when my mother came to the door and yelled for me to come to her. She made herself come to my bed and grab me out of the bed but she also couldn't bring herself to look out the window. It made the hairs stand up on our necks and we just weren't able to try and look at it. We did not smell anything that night. We could not find footprints from either of these two incidents because of the yard being covered with leaves, however we did find broken sticks where it was apparent something rather heavy had walked in order to break them (we didn't weigh enough to break them, we tried). And we did find footprints on numerous occasions out behind our home down a dirt road that went not even a quarter mile to an oil well. We also discovered hairs on the barbed wire fence. We saved some of these and I believe my parents sent them off to be analyzed, but we never heard anything from it. The hair color did not match any animals in the field nearby. The animals in the field were cows and were black and red in color. This hair was a light brown. It was also about 4 or 5 inches long. This is going to sound a little far-fetched but during the time we lived here we witnessed what we believed was a young sasquatch become mature. It happened over a period of years. We first noticed rather large 4 toed footprints (I have no idea where the 5th toe was) on the dirt road behind the house. It was larger than any man's could be. It had 5 ft. spaces between prints. And one was so heavy that it inprinted in some soft rock in the area. We watched these footprints a lot. No one we showed them to could identify them. However, bear prints were ruled out by the people we showed them to. We saw them all the time there. There was a pond nearby that maybe it was using for water. One day we noticed a smaller set of prints along side the larger ones. We watched over time as these prints got larger and larger with the other ones. Then one day it was just the one set of smaller prints. Those got larger and larger until they reached what appeared to us as grown. Even up to the time we moved from there, we had incidents and saw these prints. We also saw where it looked like something had bedded down under a rotted out tree and had packed the ground with straw. There were tiny piles of bones and feathers there too, not strewn around but arranged neatly in piles. My grandmother heard something in those woods also while hunting that sent her running so fast she lost her footing and tumbled down the hill and skinned herself up. She could not describe the sound to us, she just kept saying it was not like any sound she had ever heard. She had been tracking a buck and listening to it snort in some dense brush when she heard it from the opposite direction. It only yelled once. But that was enough to scare her so badly to cause her to hurt herself getting away and she was in shock when she got back to the others she was hunting with and her face was so white they were afraid she was going to pass out. She won't talk about it now. I will tell one other incident, and quit on that. It happened to my sister (14 at the time), a friend of my sister (also 14 at the time) and myself (11 at the time). We had walked down the dirt road behind our house and had reached just inside the edge of the woods. We starting to smell this awful smell we could not identify. We were talking about this smell when suddenly we heard a grunting/growling noise from the woods beside us. It was not very loud but it was a deep sound that terrified us. We ran immeditely home and did not venture back there alone again. We were even scared when we would go down there with family. We all often walked that road. But we all always felt like we were being watched the whole time. These woods behind our house were connected with a large swampy wooded area called Middlefork Bottom. It was connected to the Kisatchie National Forest. I must also mention that on the occasions this thing visited close to our home, our 2 dogs we had would not bark, as a matter of fact they would leave our house for 3 days at a time and not return until we went to get them from a neighbor's house down the road. If we brought them back sooner than that, they would duck their tails behind them and run away again. I have never seen brave dogs that pitiful looking. Other people who lived nearby had incidents with footprints, sounds and smells as well.",
