IT WAS OUR LAST NIGHT THERE AFTER A GREAT STAY AND LOTS OF FUN WE HAD A NICE DINNER AND ALL WANTED TO HIT THE HAY. IT WAS ABOUT 9:30 OR 10 PM WE ALL WENT TO BED.  I HAVE HUNTED ALL MY LIFE AND THE SOUND I HEARD I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE IT WAS VERY LOUD AND OFF IN THE DISTANCE IT WENT ON FOR ABOUT A MINUTE IT ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS ANGRY. THIS HAPPENED AT ABOUT 3:45AM MONDAY JUNE 11TH 2007 I JUMPED OUT OF BED AND COULD HEAR A RABBIT SCREAM LIKE SOMETHING WAS KILLING IT AFTER THAT  I DIDNT HEAR IT AGAIN.
