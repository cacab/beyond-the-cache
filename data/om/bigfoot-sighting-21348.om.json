  "observed": "My Girl friend, and her little brother and I where out at bear canyon lake camping on the weekend of august 18. It was 4:00 A.M. When I was awakened by loud foot steps. The steps sounded as though they where 20 feet away and leaving the camp sight. I then looked up and noticed that my tent Zipper on the door was more than half way open. I Then Jumped out of the bed with my side arm and a spot light to look around. I did not see any thing or any one. And the foot steps stopped. I turned off my spot light and climbed into the tent and waited to hear the steps or see a flash light for it was too dark for human to see. NOTHING!! I could smell a slight smell of dirty feet and urine at the time.",
