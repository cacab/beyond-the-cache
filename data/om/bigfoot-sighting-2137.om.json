  "observed": "I have recovered a foot print last year (July 17th I believe ). The print does not really match what a big foot print would look like according to some research that I have done after I found it. It is 22'' long, and has what appear to have sharp nails that are claw like in appearance. It resembles a human foot almost with the exception of the size, claws and the contours to it are quite different than a human print. I found the print near a small stream about 10 miles north and east of Placerville, CA. There were several prints in the area and tree branches that were broken along the stream. Only one print was worth looking at so I took some pictures of it. The next day I went back to the area and took a plaster cast of it as well.. I took the print to the Fish and Game to see if it was perhaps just a bear print or something. They thought it was a joke. I put the print in my closet and it has been there ever since. I doubt that I will ever do anything with it, but thought that if you are interested in looking at it sometime I would be happy to share it with you if you think it would be of some help to you. Bobbie. If you want any other details just ask. If you would like to publish any of this info I would like to remain anonymous. Thanks!    7-7-97",
