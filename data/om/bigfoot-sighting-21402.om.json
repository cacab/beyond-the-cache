  "observed": "I will try to explain what I saw while returning home from a day of walking in a clear cut looking for Indian artifacts. The clear cut was located at the foot  of the southeast end of the Horse range mountain near Loudesville campground In White county Georgia. I was driving on a forestry service road  when  I saw what at  first I thought that was a  Bear, about 200 yards away.  But when I stopped  and watched it. I saw that it was not. It walked upright with a slight stoop for about 75 yards down a hill toward a small creek that was bordered by trees and brush . The road crossed the creek so I thought if I went on down the road I could see it as it came out the other side, but it did not come out and I did not get of out of the Bronco to go looking for it. I did not hear any sound,and to be honest I did not tell any body about it for years until I told my Son Eric. Who contacted you. ",
