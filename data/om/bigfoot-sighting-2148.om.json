  "observed": "A friend and I were camping and he walked to Founder's Grove. He was on his way back when he heard a crash and a scream on the hill above the road, then another crash and then russling in the bushes closer to him. He stopped and waited. Nothing moved, but he said he could hear something breathing. I was about 1/2 mile away on the riverbed of the South Fork of the Eel River when I heard a very LOUD scream in the forest north of my position approximately in the area where my friend later told me his adventures occurred.",
