  "observed": "Children found footprints on the beach of the bank of the Trinity River across from Tish Tang campground, south of Hoopa on Saturday, July 22. Al Hodgson of Willow Creek arrived Monday and saw tracks a shade over 16 inches long and 7.5 inches wide. There were \"half a dozen\" altogether, but some were hard to make out. The tracks looked authentic to Hodgson. Hodgson estimated the tracks were two weeks old at least.  The best ones were at the edge of the water. They led up from the beach and upstream, ending on bedrock. Only one was of quite good quality and showed a slight arch. There were no tracks of people except of those who had found the big tracks. Grass an inch high was growing in the tracks.  Hodgson had to swim the river to get to the site.",
