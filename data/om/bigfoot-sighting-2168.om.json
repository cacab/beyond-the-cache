  "observed": "August 1989 My buddy and I do extensive camping in this area and were raised here.  We have heard many strange noises but on this particulary night we were camping in an old corn crib and around 2 pm we heard a very loud growling, hollering noise that woke both of us up from sleep.  We both looked at each other in disbeleif but decided not to let that bother us and go back to sleep. Within a few minutes we heard the same noise again, only this time louder and much closer. We have heard coyotes and screach owls but we have never anything even remotely similar to this sound.  The next day while sitting safely in our homes we discussed what we had heard and thought about big-foot but who had ever heard of a big foot in Indiana? Jay Smith Mike Davis (2001)",
