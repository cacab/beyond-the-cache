  "observed": "It was about 1:00 am on 10/21/06 when I was camping in the Palo Duro Canyon State Park for the Palo Duro Canyon trail run the following morning. I had gotten up from my sleep and was walking down to the public restroom when I heard something rustling in the trees off to the right of the road. I turned my flashlight towards the noise and was startled to see a very large chewbacca-like thing scream like it was startled and then it turned into the trees and quickly vanished. I had stopped stiff in my tracks and was scared to death. Not only had I never heard a sound like that before, but I had never seen anything like that. It was a darkish gray-brown color with hair all over its body, deep set eyes, about 7-8 feet tall, slender with long arms, and it moved very quickly. I heard someone in a camp site nearby asking what that noise was, but I just went back to my tent and got inside. I could not sleep the rest of the night. In the morning when I made it to the run, I talked to 3 other people that said they saw and/or heard the same thing. I'm going back this year, but I hope I don't see the bigfoot again.",
