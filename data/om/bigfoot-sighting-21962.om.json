  "observed": "I was bow hunting on October 24th, 2007. Around 5:45 pm I saw a large \"sasquatch\" like man about 180 yards away walking away from me. He/She was clothed in all one color. He/She was close to 8 feet tall and extremely muscualr. It was the color of dark rust. All I know is it was the scariest and most bizarre moment of my life. I climbed a small pine tree to get a better look, but he was gone. He/She dissapeared after 3-4 steps.",
