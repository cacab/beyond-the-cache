  "observed": "I live in Suwannee County 3mi from the intersection of I75 and I10. If you drew a line through the 2 Suwannee Co. sightings you show on this site, the line would go thru my house. A creek that feeds Rocky Creek, which is the creek featured in the Wellborn sighting runs 250 yards from my front door. Beavers have dammed it up and now there is a huge swamp as a result. I was walking near the swamp 3 days ago and found a footprint that measured 16in long. Conveniently the only camera i have is broken. Last night I heard a vocalization that would make your blood run cold. It was very similar to vacalizations on your site, though much loger in duration and higher pitched. It was followed by three thumps that sounded like wood being knocked together. I had a broken shovel handle in my flowerbed, and i responded by knoking the same pattern. It respoded with three more knocks. 30 seconds later i heard a similar vocalization much further away and lower pitched. im still freaking out.",
