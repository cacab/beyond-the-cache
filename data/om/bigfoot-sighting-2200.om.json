  "observed": "We were all playing and having fun with a bunch of people at the Cook's Valley Campground in Piercy. A bunch of the kids were rough-housing and playing, making a lot of noise, when we all took notice of a terrible stench. It smelled like the carcass of a rotting deer and skunk combined. It really stunk! We looked around to see where the smell was coming from, and there at the edge of the tree line stood a huge ape that we here in Garberville recognized immediately as a sasquatch. He had been standing there watching the children hard at play. He never made any attempt to come into the campground any further, but just stood there watching all the activity on the playground. At the nearest, the bigfoot was about 50 feet away from the closest child. He was brown, hairy and stood at least 8 feet tall. This was the last occurrance of a sighting of sasquatch in this area since 1963.",
