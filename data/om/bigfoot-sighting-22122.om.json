  "observed": "I was at a conference in Miami and I decided to take a hike in the big cypress preserve.  After a couple hours of hiking and on my way back I found a track.  That's when everything changed and my energy level went way up. It was off to the side of the old road or trail I was on. Looked like it probably been made after the water covering the road at one time had receded. I circled the track, going farther out each time looking for more. I got my camera and a measuring tape. It measured about 14\" long and 6\" wide and was probably about a week or two old. About 1 inch deep.  Still holding its shape I could make out the outline of four toes. As I was measuring and taking photos I found myself looking over my shoulder every couple of minutes.",
