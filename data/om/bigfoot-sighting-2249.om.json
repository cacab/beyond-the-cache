  "observed": "This the first of three so-called sightings. Me and my fishin' buddy, Greg, were fishing the back side of Morris Dam, knockin' shi_ out of Smallmouth bass and an occasional huge trout or crappie. It's not legal to trespass there, so we are very quiet and do not use lights. We are one with nature, so-to-speak. At around 3:30-4:00 a.m., we started back to the car. A quarter mile walk through dense brush, across the river (up to waist deep). We used deer trails, like tunnels, to get through the thick brush. We grabbed our hefty stringer (no fish story) and headed into the bush, without really speaking. We knew the routine well. About 50 yards into the bush, Greg and I both noticed that someone (human) was walking in front of us, about 20 feet ahead. We both stopped. The footsteps took two steps more, then stopped. Greg and I looked at each other, surprised, and simultaneously, drew our Buck knives. We couldn't see anything. We proceeded cautiously, our knives drawn. The footsteps continued in front of us. After about 30 feet, we came to the edge of a clearing and stopped. Two more steps and \"it\" stopped again. Only this time in the middle of the clearing. We looked at each other, looked back at \"it\", and, simultaneously, said \"Who's there?\" \"It\" turned 90 degrees up river and took off running through dense brush, in the black of night, like a halfback for the Rams, like no human can!",
