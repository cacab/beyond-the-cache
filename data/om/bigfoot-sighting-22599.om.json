  "observed": "I was out in the spring of the year scouting around for turkeys on the southern side of Jacks Mountain near the small village of Ellen Chapel (close to Lewistown).  I heard a type of clucking sound in a thick, brushy area and walked closer to investigate.  The clucking sound caught my attention because it sounded kind of like a turkey.  What was odd, however, was that a turkey would let me approach that closely.  As I got closer to the clucking sound, I heard a very low, gutteral growl coming from the brush.  I couldn't see anything.  This growl really surprised and scared me.  I began walking away, but then curiosity got the better of me and I approached the area slowly again.  Once again, as I got closer, the low growl occurred.  Black bears are commonly seen around this area, but I can't imagine that a black bear would simply hold still that close to a human and growl.  Whatever was growling at me was very well concealed because I couldn't see a thing.  So after hearing this growl two or three times, I got freaked out and left.  The only other explanation I can think of--and the one I've held to for the last 25 years--is that there was another turkey hunter out in the woods, well camoflauged, who was messing with me.  I've never told anyone about this incident.  I started reading accounts here of people being growled at from thick brush and thought my experience might be of the same nature.",
