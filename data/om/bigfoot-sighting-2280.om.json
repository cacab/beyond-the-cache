Moments later we heard loud running(pacing) across the creek, as we heard the running we also heard loud crashing of debris and other types of crashing. At that time we thought that someone was trying to scare us and began yelling into the woods. After we did this we were showered with large rocks and boulders falling all aroung us. When this happened we packed up our gear and went home terrified. As we were on our way back the\"screams\" continued.",
