  "observed": "While headed back to Denver from Buena Vista, My wife and I saw something very large pass in front of another car. This car was in front of us by about 25 feet. The weather was not good as it was snowing and dark out.  I was driving about 12 to 15 miles per hour. At first I thought that it was a person getting out of the car infront of us.  This struck me as odd considering the weather and the time of night, not to mention the location. We were in a 4x4 pick up and I guessed this thing to be about 7 to 8 feet tall. Very dark body with a large head and huge hands. It crossed the highway in a smooth fluid motion, paying no mind to the vehicles coming in either direction.It crossed the road in three or four strides, then disappeared of to the west side of the road. My wife and I remaind speechless for a couple of minutes and then I asked her what she thought she saw. She said it looked like bigfoot. I agreed.",
