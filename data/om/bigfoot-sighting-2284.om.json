As we rounded the narrow road, in between the creek on the right side and the tree farm on the left, we both saw a creature in the middle of the road. It was about 5-6 ft. tall, hunched over, and hairy except for it's face. It looked at us then ran (lurched?) to the left side of the road into the woods. We looked at each other and then left the scene witout leaving the car.",
