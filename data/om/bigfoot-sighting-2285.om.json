  "observed": "It was spring break 1984 and I was 16 at the time. My dad myself and my brother were on this trip to visit my mother in Florida. When we got about half way through Virginia I was just looking out the window, bored of course,  then bam! Just like that I see this large hairy black creature walking in the woods in between the trees about 20 or 30 yards away from the road I believe. At first I thought I was losing my mind and it didnt make any sense to see something that should not exist. I was blown away.  It just walked along un-disturbed by the moving cars. My younger brother looked and saw the creature moving along as well. When I saw this creature I finally blurted out Bigfoot! My dad had his eyes on the road and thought we were joking or something. I will never forget that day and as far as I am concerned bigfoot is very much a reality. It looked very much like the bigfoot in the Patterson film almost identical I would say. The creature was a classic giant ape that looked heavy. About 8 feet tall and weighing upwards of 500 pounds I suppose. It had a very long stride with arms swaying back and forth and its head a little bit lowered, it really did look very similar to the bigfoot in the 67' Patterson film. The hair was jet black head to toe, I couldnt make out any facial features. I asked my brother about this the other day (he lives in Georgia), he said he saw the same thing but not in the detail I did because we were cruising along at 60mph, but my brother said it was very large, black, stood upright and was moving along.",
