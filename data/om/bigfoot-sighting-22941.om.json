  "observed": "My late Grandparents owned a home outside of Scottsville, Kentucky for many years in Allen County.  The area has always been well-known for sightings of the \"monkey man\" as he is called there throughout this area of Kentucky (Monkey Man Hollow).  The first sightings began back in the old pioneer days.  This story is true because my late Grandmother, an honest woman and Christian, saw one of these \"bigfoot\" creatures on two seperate occasions both at night time.  I was there during one encounter she had as well.  This creature would come into their front yard at night and lean up or kneel down against a large beech tree in their front yard.  She described the creatures as standing tall and upright, and walking like a man.  Both creatures were covered with white, and somewhat curly, hair all over.  I thought they may be older ones of these creatures because of the white hair.  The creatures just got up and walked away on two feet just like a person would do back into the woods.  Also, a friend and neighbor who lived down the road from them saw a Sasquatch one time leaning against a fence post in his front yard across a road in broad daylight.  He has told this story to lots of people many times, and always the same way.  When his dogs gave chase to the creature, tall and upright like a man with brown hair all over, just leaped over the fence and walked away into the valley below. Although I haven't seen one of these creatures, I did hear screaming sounds like a woman would make one night when I stayed overnight with them.  It woke us all up.  Trust me, this eerie sound would make your hair stand on end, and this was no ordinary animal sound either.  They always told me that it was just that \"thing\" that lives in the woods.  Many people throughout the years have seen these creatures all across the Allen County area.  This story is absolutely true and accurate to the best of my ability.  These creatures are real!",
