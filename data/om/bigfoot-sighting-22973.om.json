  "observed": "We were on a fishing trip in the Michigan / U.P.  We had topographical maps and were looking for a lake to catch some bluegill.  While driving down a sand road through the forest in my extended cab pick up, I looked to my left (heading west, looked south) and saw sitting in a tree about 30 - 45 yards into the forest a young ?? ape-like creature.  It had long (possible 4 to 5 inches) reddish, dark brown to black hair but had a monkey / humanoid face that was much lighter (not white but not black like a monkey)  It sat on the limb (no tail visible) as a human would squat on the ground.  It appeared that if standing on the ground it wouldn't be much over 28 to thirty inches tall.  I was only driving about 10 mi/hr so I got a good look.  As I drove by , my son asked, \"Did you see that?\"  I answered in the affirmative and after another quarter mile, I was able to turn around and go back.  When we got back to where the incident had taken place, it was gone.  I asked my son to point to where he had seen it and he pointed to the exact same spot I had seen it.  I asked him to describe it and he described the same thing.  My father was in the front seat with me and did not see it.  He advised that we should report it, but I thought little of it and went on with life in gereral.",
