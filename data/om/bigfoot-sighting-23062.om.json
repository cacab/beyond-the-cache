  "observed": "Hello, I grew up in the Sierra Nevada mountains (Lake Tahoe).  I am an avid outdoorsman that has hiked from Mexico to Canada.  I have always believed that there is bigfoots running around. I now live in Seattle and go to the Cascades to fly fish on a very regular basis. A couple years ago I was fishing a little creek that is a trib to the Middle fork of the Snoqualmie. As I approached the creek I saw a large footprint.  The hair on my neck stood up.  I looked at the other side of the creek and their was another large track.  Not bear, not lion- like nothing I have seen before or since. I got a little spooked because the tracks looked quite fresh.  As I broke back through the alder on the way back to the car I sensed something looking at me.  Very scary, like I was being followed.  I got within 30 feet of my ride and heard breathing coming behind me but no footsteps.  I jumped in and sped away.  I was very spooked.  I would be willing to show an expert where I saw the prints.  I will not go back their on my own.  Not that it would hurt me, but more that it was an ominous presence.  Please respond to me, I am not lying to you.",
