The prints, described as 14 to 15 inches in length, were spotted this morning near the area where Sunday night reports placed a grotesque 10-foot-tall man and repeated shrieking noises.  The tracking party, lead by Sheriff Miller Sardella, reportedly followed prints north of Peter Pam subdivision, through Jenness park and the Sierra Boy Scout camp area below Cold Springs. Tracks were first spotted yesterday by reserve Deputy Elbert Miller, and original reports from the sheriff's office set the size of the prints at 15 to 17 inches.  Miller lost the trail among cabins in the Jenness park area. Sardella, with Deputies William Huntley and Pete DeMott, returned to the area this morning and spotted additional footprints. Sardella described the tracks as shoe prints, apparently made before last night's light snowfall.  He said cabins in the area were checked but officers found no evidence of break-ins. The sheriff said they saw fresh mountain lion tracks in the area.  Noting mountain lions will stalk and screech at a human, Sardella suggested a lion as the possible source of noises heard Sunday night by Miller and Huntley. At the time, Miller had described the shrieks as somewhat like a mountain lion but assured, \"It's not a mountain lion noise.\"",
