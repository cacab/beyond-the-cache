  "observed": "While squirrel hunting on Bayou Bodcaw on a clear and sunny morning, I heard dogs running what I thought was a deer on the west side of the creek. I was standing on the east side appx. 20 ft from the bank looking for squirrel in cypress den trees. The creek was about 30 to 40 yards wide with banks 10 to 12 ft high. As the dogs drew closer I put a 12 ga 00 buckshot in my shotgun. I then saw what I thought was a person break through some bursh and slide down the bank almost to the water. It then crawled back up the bank and turned and looked my way. This creature had reddish brown hair all over its body about the length of a deer's hair. It stood appx. 6 to 6.5 feet tall. Due to its hair I could only make out its nose and eyes features. After a few seconds it turned north and jogged up the creek until it was out of sight. The next day I told my dad about this. He asked why I didn't shoot it.  I told him it looked too much like a man.",
