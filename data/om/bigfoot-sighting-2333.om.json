  "observed": "I was listening to Art Bell last night and they where talking about bigfoot....Art played a couple of clips of bigfoot sounds taken I think in Oregon or Washington. When he played the sounds I was driving in my truck (I am a truck driver) and had to pull off the road. The sounds brought back a memory I had tried to forget. I was a teenager at the time.  My parents, Aunt, Uncle, brother and I where up in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California on a deer hunting camping trip. We were well away from civilization and the only other people near us was another small group of campers on the other side of the small valley we where in.  My family had camped in this particular spot for years and have never up to that point had anything strange happen. The second night we were all in our respective tents, when out of nowhere there came a sound unlike any we have ever heard in the woods.  To reflect on it now, and before I had heard the sounds that Art Bell played, I would have described it as being somewhere between a woman screaming and a mountain lion's loud roar. After hearing Art's sound file, I now say it was more like that. I am at this time trying to locate a copy of these sound clips to hear again and play them for my parents to see what they think.",
