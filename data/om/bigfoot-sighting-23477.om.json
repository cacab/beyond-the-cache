  "observed": "My financee and I were coming down I-64 east from Beckley, West Virginia, at approximately 6:45 pm. My financee said, “Holy crap, I just saw Bigfoot, 3 possibly 4!\"  We turned around and high tailed it back to the spot. The sighting took place at the Hinton exit. There is a visitor's center off to the left. We went to the road she saw them and parked. I got out and looked around and within a minute I spotted the group. It consisted of 2 large and 2 smaller. The larger appeared to be at least 7 to 8 foot tall. The smaller ones were 2 foot smaller. They were solid black in color. The group was approximately 150ft away, towards the top of a small hill. The 2 larger were standing up hill from the 2 smaller ones sitting. The group was moving back and forth. The 2 larger would squat then stand back up again, at least 4 times. I then made a howling noise and the largest one began to sway back and forth between 2 trees. He looked like a gorilla at the zoo holding the bars and going back and forth. I howled again and he moved downhill towards one of the smaller ones and bent over near it. There was enough light behind them for me to see arms and legs and what appeared to be a huge upper body on the largest one. The reach I saw between trees had to be at least 6ft. My fiancée was very scared and said we need to go. We got back in the car and moved about 20ft. and I saw more movement. We stopped again and I got out and saw 1 of the larger ones walk over the hill. Then I saw one of the smaller ones stand up. We left at that point. My fiancée had been a skeptic to a point, I was always a believer. Tonight changed our lives forever. Of course we called several people to share our experience. Now I am here sharing with you.",
