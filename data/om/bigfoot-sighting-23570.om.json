  "observed": "Me and my friend were going out into the woods to explore the Apalachicola National Forest, we heard the sound of a stream or creek so we went to go check it out. It was a small and shallow brook layered with 5-10 lbs rocks, so we washed off, cooled down and as we were leaving the brook it was out of sight but not sound, we heard some noises of rocks moving and colliding or being tossed into other rocks. We were nervous of a wild animal. As we approached we heard like a hog running off, only we caught a glimpse of an ape like mammal charging through and away from the brook. The rocks on the bank and in the water were moved and jumbled in a very distinct way.  Because of the leaves, there was no other prints except one upper left side of a left foot imprinted in the mud touching the water.  We tried to preserve it, but as we returned to the cars, the mud had fried and cracked, we had no camera, sorry.",
