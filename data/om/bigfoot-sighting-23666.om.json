  "observed": "Around 6:45pm on April 23rd, 2008, as my son and I were coming into the US from Canada.  We were traveling west about 14 miles on the US side of the US Canada border on the Alcan highway.   My son was driving.  If you've ever driven that road, then you know how the pavement has huge dips in it, I suspect from the freezing and thawing of the foundation of soil under the pavement.  Anyway, my son was watching directly in front of the car to make sure we took the smoothest path around some upcoming heaves in the pavement.  I was watching further down the highway as I had done our entire trip from Lethbridge, AB.  My hope was to catch a glimpse of a bear, moose or some awesome wildlife or some kind.   Anyway, we were on a slight decent down a hill, making a slight left corner and about to start up the other side when I saw what I thought was a human crossing the road, may 3-tenths of a mile ahead of us and up then slight incline.  He was a tall, odd looking fellow and I joked to myself when I first saw him..  \"Well, there is sasquatch up the road\", fully expecting to see that a person had crossed from a house or something on the left-hand side of the road over to another house or something on the right hand side.  When we got to the point where the structures should have been, there was nothing..  I mean nothing.  And no sign of any human, animal or anything else on the right hand side of the road in the woods.  This thing was walking upright like a man, long arms and what looked like a long neck from the side.  It had a fairly long gape in his walk..arms swinging with each stride.  It was all one color...I described it to my wife as the color of a Carhartt rust/brown full cover-alls.  I called her first thing when we got cell coverage in Tok.  She got on the web and saw where this was not the first time a sighting happened in this very same area.  I was so glad that someone else had seen it!  I hate to say it, but he looked similar to the representations on TV and pictures!  By the way, I have always thought this whole thing was a bunch of nonsense.  If nothing else, someone was wearing a suit to make them look like the sasquatch character.",
