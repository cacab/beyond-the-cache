  "observed": "a vocalization, repeatedly for about 3 hours on 05-12-08. My dogs were going nuts the entire time, waking me up repeatedly from 0130 hours until 0430 hours. About 3 am went out to try to figure out why the dogs ere so on edge, heard a series of calls simmilar to the \"lonesome\" call that is heard on the \"southern calls\" on your site. On 05-13-08 in the evening, I called 3 neighbors, and all reported the same restless dog behavior. I also had a neighbor volunteer a description of  \"seeing a set of dark yellow to red eyes in his back yard about a week and a half ago when he stepped out to have a cigarette\" the interesting thing is that the eyes seen under a million candle spotlight, and using a high stump as a reference point, were described to me as being 8' off the ground....the interesting thing is that he stated that he either saw 2 eyes in the light or nothing....his sighting was about 60 yards away..... this week and a half ago time stamp also matches my dogs going crazy all night last wednesday from 1130 to about 0230 am. I plan to conduct an \"on site\" interview with the neighbor and report my findings at a later date. By the way, I am college educated, a military veteran, a veteran animal control control officer for well over a decade, a lifelong successful bowhunter for elk, deer, and bear. I'm \"redneck\" by choice, and own a ranch that is at the northmost end of county roads and human habitation on the west bank of the wynoochee river, on the Olympic penninsula of washington state. I am all real and credible.. the vocalization that was heard was a drawn out sine wave ....a searching call.....most likely a mating call from a lone male in my opinion....",
