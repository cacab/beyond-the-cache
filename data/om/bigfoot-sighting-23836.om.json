  "observed": "This story has been told by my father, I remember him coming home as a kid an telling us his hunting stories,this story was the best, this story was never talked about again until this year when i learned about this site, I ask my father now in his late 60s about the story he told when we were kids, this happened in 1976, my father is an avid bowhunter, while leaving a deer stand and heading back to the house, he noticed a large man standing on the edge of a small  field, directly across from him. he had thought it was another hunter that hunted on the farm, my dad whistled at him to let him know he was there, there was no response, so he whistled again, no response, keep in mind this is a small winter wheat field.food plot.approx 100 yards across, my dad said he stopped and studied the figure and realized it was very tall, and it was not a man, he said his hair stood up, and he made his way to a dried up slough and headed towards the house, while navigating his way he said he could hear limbs popping behind him, when he stopped to listen it would stop, when he moved again it would move, he never seen the creature again until this year 32 years later in November 2008, while deer hunting again on the same farm, he called me and told me he seen something again, on the farm, this time he only got a glimpse of it, it was on its belly crawling up a deer trail out of a slough, he said it was black in color,and very large, he said he only got a glimpse of it and believed it to be one of the creatures. This area has very heavy jungle like foliage, if you have ever been in the river Missouri  bottoms, you know what I am describing, my dad would never tell this or report this to anyone. I have decided to do it so the info is out there.",
