  "observed": "I was turkey hunting this spring. It was just breaking daylight and I heard some breaking branches. I was looking the way the branches were being broke and I seen a large figure heading down the draw. I watched it as far as I could and it finally just vanished into the woods. I have hunted these woods for 20 years and never seen anything like it. It was around 7 or 8 feet tall and it looked like it had a hunch back. The light was just wrong but it looked like it was hairy and had long arms.",
