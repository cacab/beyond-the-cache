  "observed": "My father, Kenneth W., and his friend, were fishing at a large creek known as Chambers Creek between the towns of Avalon and Ennis, TX in Ellis County.  During this excursion, a large, hulking, hairy creature, approximately eight to ten feet tall appeared before them and roared, bearing its arms.  My father and his friend were, of course, frightened nearly hysterically, and proceeded to run, got into my father's truck, and sped ten miles back to Ennis.  This so-called \"Chambers Creek Monster\" was seen by various people following my father's sighting, but since then, it has never been seen again.",
