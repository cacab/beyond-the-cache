  "observed": "This incident occurred in late September or early October in 2002.  I was living in Seney at the time and working in Manistique in the U.P. of Michigan.  I would take the Manistique river road to work every day to try and bag a couple of partridge on the way in.  This is a gravel road that runs along the river from Germfask to Manistique.  On this day, I left early and drove slowly for about the first half of the road.  I had shot one bird, and chased another into the popples a way, and realized that I was close to being late. I cased up my shotgun and jumped in the car and put the hammer down in the 1991 Ford Fiesta.  About 45mph is pretty fast on this road, but I had driven it many times.  With the river on the right and white pine stands on the left, I was approaching an area called the \"second high bank.\"  I saw movement on the left in the pines, and slowed down thinking to avoid hitting a deer. About 30 to 40 yards ahead of me I saw what can only be described as a sasquatch approach the road, then pause and look in my direction, and apparently, change his mind and turn and run parallel to the road in the direction I was travelling.  This scared the s*** out of me.  I slowed down but was scared to stop, and I didn't want it to jump me in the small car, so I jammed brakes, and reversed a couple hundred yards.  I took my single shot 20 ga. out of the case and loaded it with birdshot.  Still scared to go back in the direction I was headed, I sat there for about 2 to 3 minutes, until a pickup truck with another hunter approached from the same direction I had come.  I let him pass and then followed him on through to Manistique.  As I passed the area where the sasquatch had been I looked for sign, but saw none.  I have never told anyone about this until recently, when a friend of mine told me of a similar occurrence that had happened to his aunt.  He told me about this web site.",
