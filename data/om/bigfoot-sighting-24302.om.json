  "observed": "I have hunted, hiked and camped the sierra anchas since the early 70s. I found a fresh track in the mud on the old homestead that was about one and a half times my shoesize and I wear a 11eee. Biggest and heaviest I ever saw of a human like print. It was fresh and I didnt want to be around there if it came back. I have camped in the old barn there and heard heavy footsteps about 2am in the morning, but didnt see anything in the morning cept for trampled grass. Also another time my neighbors heard growling in the brush while camping there and left. Not to far from there next to another homestead with another orchard like the previous one I heard all kinds of big rocks being thrown and tearing around in the brush, I retreated quickly. I found a deer that had all been torn up another time the legs been ripped of and something had been eating just parts of it which was puzzling to me as I have seen lion and coyote kills. A forest employee said somebody had been pushing down the hiking trail signs and now I am wondering. In 1981 I came home from a successful deer hunting trip and was about 10-15 miles north of globe heading there when I came around the corner and there was a dark figure standing there about 10 yards off the road on my side. The eye shine was bright red and frightened me. I slowed down to back up but decided no, I have a deer in the back that needs skinning and my pregnant wife was with me and I decided to skattle out of there. I had forgotton all about these incidents until I read the reports and it came back to me. I didnt think about bigfoots in Az.",
