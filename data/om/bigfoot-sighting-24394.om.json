  "observed": "I was backpacking alone deep in the  alpine lakes and on friday August eigth 2008 things got really weird. I had stopped and set up camp at a lake and on the first day every thing was normal .I had the lake all to myself as to be expected because of lakes remoteness and hard climb .Lake is situated in a box canyon with great acoustics and I was banging away on my guitar and singing loudly bouncing my sounds off the walls and echoing out a large area,I was also hooting and making strange calls as too attract or scare any game and or let someone know I was there. Second day I set out for day hike and exploration and things got weird.I head over to other side of the lake along a sheer wall that rises about 1000 feet up to summit straight up almost jumping large rock screes and swinging with the aid of blueberry bushes 40 feet above lake i reach the other side  to a level area and begin planned day hike . Upon returning to level area I glanced up to the ridge above and instantly draw onto the hi-gloss sheen of something  against the flat color of fauna and rock wich I percieve to be game.  I then try too rouse it withh verbal calls and arm wavings but nothing happens and after several minutes I give up and swing back the half mile to camp. It is now about 4 o'clock and I'm cooking dinner and I hear a screech  coming from where I just came from , nothing to out of the ordinary , could of been a cat or a screech owl but it  makes me uncomfortable I decide to gather lots of wood for a good firen . night falls and I continue  to play my guitar and make lots of noise because I have this uneasy feeling, kinda of an I'm big and bad here attitude I build the fire big and retreat to my tent and fall asleep. At around 11 o'clock I'm guessing I am awaken to this incredibly loud  crack somewhat like a high velocity rifle but louder like close lightning and then the sound of large rocks falling. This startles the crap out of me and  I un-zip  my tent and start shouting obscenities and  try to make myself big and scary, even to the point of barking like a dog. My earlier paranoia has gotten to me and I become un-nerved and frightened.I quickly  re-build the fire and am all ears and eyes except that theres nothing too see because of the pitch blackness. About 40 minutes later it happens again but closer to me this time and I kinda loose it again and start screaming and barking all over again.I stay awake frightened untill first light and not hearing another sound I quickly load up my gear and get the heck out. Upon returning I feel foolish for getting un-nerved and sort the situation up to my own paranoia and a natural occurance of possibly trees snaping off the ledge and or rocks breaking off and doing the same. I  am interested in returning back immediatly , but not alone . If you know two backpackers with cameras and gear who could be ready quickly for a three day hike, I would be interested  to take them and try to re-create what happened, not that anything would. I t would have to be quickly in the Seattle area. contact me at goattrailblazer@yahoo.com",
