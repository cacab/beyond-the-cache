  "observed": "A friend and I were fishing on Holt lake in tuscaloosa county on day after work.  It was a thursday about mid july of last year (1999).  We had gotten on the water about 6:30 and started fishing.  We put in at Rocky Branch and went up river towards the upper end lock.  Towards night fall we started fishing back toward the launch.  about 11:30 we were fishing a secluded part of the shoreline.  The nearest house was probably 2-3 miles down river.  We were fishing close to the bank when I heard something walking at the top of the hill.  I figured it was a deer and didn't pay it any more attention.  As we proceeded down the bank the sound started down the hill towards us.  There were two distinct foot steps instead of four like a deer.  I thought I was hearing things so I looked back at my buddy and he was looking up the hill towards the sound.  We decided to go look for another fishing spot (because we were getting a little spooked)and started putting everthing up to make our run.  As we were doing that, whatever it was broke into a run towards us.  Before we could get the boat cranked the creature let out the most herendous snarl and growl I had ever heardand then hit the water after us.  We both love to hunt and spend alot of time outdoors but neither of us had ever heard anything like that, nor could we duplicate it when we would tell people of our encounter.  I hadn't thought anything else about it until we got on this web site and heard the recording of the growl sound.  That was the closest thing I have heard to the sound we heard that night.  I'v read that usually there is a strong musty smell preceeding most encounters, but we didnt smell anything unusual. Perhaps this was due to the fact that we were in a cross wind with the creature.  We don't know exactly what it was because we havent gotten up the nerve to go back and look around.  That was probably the last time I have been on the lake.  Everyone we told about this said we were crazy and were hearing things, but none of them will go back with me at night to look for it.  Due to the pale color of my face when I got home about 45min-1hrs later, my girlfriend will not even go the lake.  Its about 30min off of HWY59 exit 100 in brookwood Al.",
