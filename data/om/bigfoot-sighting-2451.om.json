  "observed": "In May of 1986 my son-in-law and I found a freshly made footprint of something that still haunts me today.  We had been cutting firewood in a mostly remote area about 100 miles south of St Louis, MO.  It had rained hard all night prior to the morning of the sighting and the ground was well saturated.  The print looked almost like a human print except for the size and the number of toes.  The print was 14-1/2\" long, 4-3/4\" wide and was sunk in the ground almost 2\" deep it had to be something that had a lot of weight to it.  It also had three toes of which the inside toe was slightly larger than the other two.  Unfortunately we did not take a picture or  make a cast of it.  I wish I would have at least informed the conversation department about it.",
