  "observed": "The last two nights I have had interactions with what I think might be Bigfoots.  I live out in the country and have over the last few weeks been wood knocking in my backyard.  Last night at about 9:30pm I smacked the tree 5 times and immediately got a strange high pitched chatter to my left (south by southwest) and then another grumbling sound about 100 yards to the left of the first sound. My step-son also heard this with me and pointed in the same direction to the sounds which only lasted for a minute.  We did some more wood knocking but never heard anymore. I awoke at around 4:00am to go to the bathroom (window was open) and was barely awake when I heard a distinct 4 knocks from across the pond (my backyard faces a pond) where there is no one living closer than a half mile from that area.  It woke me up immediately and made the hair stand up on my neck. My dog growled and barked when she heard the knocking and growled for several minutes.  When she stopped I went back to bed.  Tonight (9/20) 12:30am I took our other dog out for the night to relive herself and walked over to the tree and picked up the log and smacked it 5 times. I started making guttural sounds and got an immediate response making the same sounds back at me.  There was also another sound with it like the night before which was high pitched chattering.  This repeated for about a minute when I realized I had no witnesses and went into the house to get my wife.  When we came back outside the only sound we got was of a tree branch breaking, and it was loud and distinctive. About 10 min. later I heard 4 knocks to my right (north by northwest) maybe a mile away.  I came into the house and filled this out right away.",
