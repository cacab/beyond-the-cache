  "observed": "After 2 years I feel that it is time to share my experience I had. It was October 2006 I was Deer hunting with my girlfriend in the Wynoochee Valley area. We stopped at a spur road and walked down to the edge of a landing to look for deer. After standing at the edge of the landing a knocking noise started. I noticed it immediately. It was coming from the creek bottom which was probably a good 7 to 800 yards down the hill. It sounded like 2 pieces of wood hitting each other, hence knocking. At first I thought it was someone using a hammer or something but thought, \"why in the heck would somebody be all the way down in that canyon hammering something?!\". I decided to descend into the clear cut to get a better listen. As I descended I noticed the knocking noise stopped. But as soon as I stopped it started again. This went on several times until I was probably 5 to 600 hundred yards away. The hairs on the back of my neck started to stand right up and I started to get goosebumps so I climbed back up the hill and got out of there. It just felt like something was watching me because of the starting and the stopping of the knocks as I moved down towards it. Ive been hunting all of my life and have NEVER felt that way in the woods. It was just plain creepy.",
