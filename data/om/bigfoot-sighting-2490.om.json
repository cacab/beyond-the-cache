  "observed": "I was camping at a spot called Big Slide just outside of Hyampom, California in Trinity County. There were at least five of us all sleeping on the beach of the South Fork of the Trinity river. I woke up in the night, having heard something loud enough to make me sit up.  It was a bright moon that night and I could see across the river to the other bank quite clearly.  I saw a large creature on two legs shaking a tree.  It was a huge pine tree, I remember looking to the top of the tree and registering that it was a BIG tree to be shaking with such force. I tried to wake the friend to my right, no one else awoke.  I had no doubt in my mind that I was seeing Bigfoot.  Everyone there knew Trinity Co. was a stomping ground for them. The river was running so I never heard any noise from it's mouth.  It eventually stopped it's tree shaking and ran down the beach in an arc and off into the woods.  I told myself that I would check it's footprints out in the morning.  I went to sleep. The next day I remembered it all like a dream coming back.  I took my biggest friend over to the other side of the river and we found the tracks in the sand.  We had him run into the sand from the forest and back out again, just as I had seen the Bigfoot do.  He was a 6' man weighing at least 180 and his tracks shrank to about half the size of the prints that we had found in the sand. We all agreed that it was odd.  We all agreed that the prints were REAL and not from a bear or a man.",
