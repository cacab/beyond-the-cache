  "observed": "My wife and I were hiking at the Wildcat Ridge near Rockaway, NJ  on Saturday October 18th around 1 pm. I work in the area and we decided to explore the trails. We were on the black trail near the Hibernia Bat Cave when we heard two wood knocks. We responsed back with two knocks but heard nothing after. The weather was a  typical seasonal day with a clear sky. There were not many people on the trails that day. A family of three and single hiker. They were not in the area when we hear the knocks so we do not know if they heard them as well. We discovered your site and found another report from 2006 in the same area.",
