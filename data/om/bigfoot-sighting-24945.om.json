  "observed": "First Day of deer season. Late afternoon. Animal appears above me and walked from right to left down grade at a distance of 30 yards.  Seen from his left side view.  Appeared very tall. Arms extended below his knees.  Long brown shaggy hair. Hair at this head appeared to be longer as if it came to his sholders.  Pug face from side view.  Long legs and long stride.  Four to five feet stride(measured by my boot length).  Walked down to my elevation and around the hill and down a logging road into a meadow.  Then out of the meadow down the road out of site.  Time elapsed 2 to 3 minutes.  I walked into the meadow trying to see it again,  no luck.  Gone!!!",
