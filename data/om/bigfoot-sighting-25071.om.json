  "observed": "Around 7am, let's say the first week of November of 2007, I was making a phone call to try and get some help on a very large roof I was working on. Standing to the right of the house, facing the back, is a large open grassy field surrounded by woods. I was looking to the back staring at this particular tree that stood out to me, when suddenly something very tall, very large, stepped away from the tree looking at me. My arm with the phone dropped and my jaw dropped and I was thinking to myself, \"What the **** is that!\". It's fur was brown to reddish brown and it covered the entire body that I could see from the waist up. Just as quickly as I had seen it, it made its way across the field in a matter of seconds.  I was on the phone but I took note of where I was standing and what was around me. Next to me were a couple of snowmobiles and about 5 feet in front of me was a red quad and I was on the far right corner of concrete pad. The grass was very high because the day before I had noticed a couple of deer walking through the field and all I could see was their back, neck and heads. The next day my brother-in-law came out and we walked back where I saw this thing. When I looked back towards the house I couldn't see the red quad or the snowmobiles at all. I saw no clear footprints out there. There were lots of trails through the grass that could have been made by anything. When this thing ran across the field it was slightly leaning forward. It had to have been at least 7 or 8 feet tall in order for me to see its entire upper body over the grass. The next day when I showed up I couldn't get in the house because the alarm had been triggered. I called the home owner and he said that something triggered the basement door alarm and a basement window alarm that night. He had to leave in a hurry and forgot to reset the alarm. I thought that was very interesting, but I did not tell him what I had seen the morning before.",
