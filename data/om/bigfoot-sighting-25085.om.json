  "observed": "It was December,2007. My husband and I and our two dogs were home and My husband was lying on the couch with our dogs,he was reading the newspaper and watching tv. I came into the living room to tell him something, as I was leaning over him,something caught my attention out of my periphiel vision. I saw what looked like two red spots at the _top of my blinds on our living room window. I turned to look at it further and soon the two red spots formed eyes, very large eyes, I kept watching from where I stood and the eyes looked right at me,we were looking at each other. I wasn't frightened,just astonished to what I was seeing,and then what ever it was it turned it's head and walked away from my window. Just to state a fact of point,my mini-blinds were white, down all the way and the blinds themselves were folding downward,so,anyone outside can see in,but,if they are up you can't see in. Mind you,Our moble home is 14' high and 70'long on two acres of land in a rual area.outside of Montrose,PA. We sold our property in Feb.2008. I never went outside to investigate what I saw, I figured that I would leave well enough alone,just let whatever it was be on it's intended journey. Although, I am amazed that niether dog reacted to it.",
