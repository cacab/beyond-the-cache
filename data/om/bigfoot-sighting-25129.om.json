  "observed": "I went to a hunting spot to see what was happening, just around the time the sun was getting low. I arrived at a spot that i knew had a persimmon tree to see if i could see any deer in the area, about 15 minutes after arriving i noticed an animal standing up and getting persimmons and going back to the ground about 75 yards away, i thought this was a bear. I watched it for about 20 minutes and was getting ready to leave because it was starting to get dark. Just as i was getting ready to stand up and leave this animal did just that, stood up and left. I watched it get up on two legs and walk away, i observed this for at least 40 yards and it disappeared into the thick growth.",
