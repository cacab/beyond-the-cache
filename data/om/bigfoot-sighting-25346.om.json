  "observed": "It all started around mid May 2008. I went to feed my two pit bulls around 11:30 pm one night, me and my wife had returned home late from eating out.  While taking the dogs food to them I heard a long moan / howl coming from the woods behind my house I at first thought it was my neighbor but it just did not make sense because it actually sounded farther off in the woods than my neighbors house sits. It stopped me dead in my tracks. I started surfing the internet later on after that and came across the BFRO website and played a few vocalizations and the Ohio Moan / Howl sounded just like the one I heard.  I actually talked to a couple of investigators on the matter. Since then I have become very interested in  Bigfoot and Sasquatch sightings and news. I decided to ask my wife if she had heard or seen anything unusual around the woods and house, she asked me why and I reluctantly  told her I thought I had heard a Sasquatch in the woods. She started laughing and said “ I guess they throw rocks at the house and garage too”. Well my jaw dropped I asked her what she meant and she told me that the whole time I was  deployed to Iraq (2005-2006)when she would come out on the back porch to smoke at night some one would throw rocks and sticks at our garage which  is not attached to our house and sits back in the wood line some. She even had her brother come out and listen one night while he was down on vacation it freaked both of them out. That was pretty much the extent of every thing until 3 nights ago, the weather had turned really cold here in Ga and when I would go out to smoke at night I would not stay long. It was during one of the brief smoke breaks that around 1:00 AM I was staring out into the front yard when I caught some movement in the corner of my eye, I turned my head just in time to see the massive back, shoulders and head of this enormous creature disappear behind some bushes. It was fairly close to the yard light I have in my yard but just far enough away to not be able to tell the actual color of this thing I would guess a dark brown or grayish. I went out and measured a limb that I am fairly sure was about even with its head and the limb measured at exactly 10 feet so the height was about 10 feet tall it was slightly hunched over with no visible neck and a shoulder width, the best I can guess, of about 3-4 feet across it looked like it covered the distance of 6-7 feet with one step ( although I could not see its legs and feet I am judging by its gate) I could not see its face but its fur looked like a horses winter coat that had not been combed out.
