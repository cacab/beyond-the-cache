  "observed": "I always tell this story whenever there is big foot conversation. However, I have never reported the incident to an official source. The creature was witnessed by myself, my sister, brother-in-law, my brother, and two of my cousins (both male.) Here's the real nutty part. The sighting was in Hendersonville, TN. Whereas there was (at the time of sighting) a lot of wooded land, it is by no means a wilderness. At the time of sighting, Hendersonville was experiencing phenomenal growth.  Here's what happen. My brother Eddie, my two cousins James and Larry and I were spending the weekend with my sister (Nell) and brother-in-law (Leo). Their's was a new house next to the last one in the development at that time. The subdivision was a new one cut into some of the wooded area of Hendersonville. We turned int the driveway of the house and when the headlights from the car straighten down the driveway Leo abruptly stopped the car and said, \"What the hell is that?\" We all looked. The creature was digging in the trash can at the end of the driveway(its right side towards us). As the lights hit it, it turned and looked in our direction then looked in the direction of its regress (never looked in our direction again) and casually stride away. Leo got out of the car and went through the front door of the house and got his gun. We all watched as the creature ran (not fast) away on two legs. Never did it drop on all fours. It was not even built for all fours. It was man-like (and please, give us some credit, it was not a bear)about eight feet tall and completely covered with medium dark brown hair. When Leo got back outside the creature was gone. The next door neighbor's dog (always barking at us and everything else) did not make a sound and we found him hiding under the neighbor's back deck. At the time of this sighting, we had never heard of a big foot. We did not even think to look for hair of footprints or anything like that. This may sound a little odd, but we saw what we saw. I realize since this incident occurred such a long time ago, it will probably be of no interest but since I had never reported this incident to an official researcher, I wanted to do so. Thanks.",
