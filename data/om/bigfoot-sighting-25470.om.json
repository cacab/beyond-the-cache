  "observed": "Now that the reporting of sightings is more common place and your not considered crazy or disoriented. The sighting ocurred almost 44 years ago. I and my brother William were out driving around the area we were vacationing in. it was a clear bright summer day in August. I was 16 years of age and my family had a red pontiac convertable so we were driving around with the top down. The location we were at was Pelican Lake Wisconsin. My relitives had a summer cottage on the lake. We decided to take a ride around the lake and got on Couny Q off of Hwy 45. This took us around the North shor of the lake. We saw a sign that led to a town called Parish. We decided to take that rode. This road as I remember was a continuation of County Q. The road was relatively strait after traveling several miles there was a very sharp turn to the right and then again very sharply to the left as though they need to avoid that section of road and could not continue with the very stait layout of the road. As my brother and myself approached the sharp jog in the road. The forest was very mature with no underbrush we were able to see clearly to the other side where the road continued. In the middle of the road walking slowly across the road was a without a doubt was a BigFoot/Sasquatch. As we approached he turned and directly look at us for several moments and then turned and moved quickly to the side of the road. We excellerated Quickly to get around the hair pin turn, when we got to the other side he/she was gone. I stopped the car and got out telling my brother who was 9 yeras old at the time, to stay in the car. I could see no trace of it as I walked up and down the road. We decided to head back to the cottage as we were both shaken. The Big Foot was 8 to 9 foot tall very slime for the height, looking like a pro basketball player in stature. It was coverd in black hair, when he turned to walk to the side of the road in a fashion similar to humans with it's arms moving back and forth piviting at the shoulder I was struck by the length of its arms. They where very long as was his stride as he moved into the woods. Its hair from its head flowed down its neck and looked like helmet. Its face was covered with hair and features were apelike but more refined. That is the best I can do on the description. Will never for get him looking at us it was amagnificent sight to see.",
