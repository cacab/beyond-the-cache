  "observed": "My sighting occurred over twenty years ago, in the fall of 1978, so I don't know if this will be helpful to anyone or not.  I was driving on highway U.S. 2 across Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which skirts the northernmost shores of Lake Michigan.  I had been been driving with my 18-month-old son in the car seat next to me, all day from Minneapolis towards St. Ignace,Mich. and had grown sleepy. So I stopped at a roadside picnic area about 20 miles east (maybe more) of Manistique, Michigan on the edge of the Hiawatha National Forest.  The picnic area contained only one picnic table and a trash receptacle, very rustic, and was surrounded by deep woods. I locked my doors (driving a Saab station wagon) checked the baby and fell asleep in the driver's seat, figuring to catch a cat nap and drive the last 100 miles or so afterward, it was about ten or eleven p.m. when I fell asleep. After only a short time, maybe two hours, I was awakened by a HORRIBLE smell, like nothing I'd ever smelled before, and I remember thinking the baby must be sick to have filled his diaper with such a rotten odor.  So I turned on my interior light and grabbed the diaper bag from the back seat, but when I checked my son's diaper, it was clean !!  He was awake and staring out the windshield (carseats didn't have to face ackwards, back then) and I followed his gaze . . . At first glance I got scared, thinking a large bear was standing on its hind legs directly in front of my car, but when I turned on the headlights, thinking this would scare the bear away, I could tell this was no bear.  I can't say how tall it was but it seemed to tower over the small car, bending forward at the waist and the lights didn't faze it at all.  It was only three or four feet away from us, leaning over the hood and staring into the car through the windshield. The creature was covered in very dark brown, long hair but it had no snout like a bear would have - rather, it had a flat face and a nose that kind of looked negroid (is that a politically correct description ?)  and I focused on the face (so almost human) so I can't describe the body.  The eyes were large, round, brown and bright but seemed to be set in the middle of the head.  By that I mean the face was centered in the large head, with no hair on the cheeks, nose or around the mouth.  The creature did not move or make a sound, but seemed to be in a staring match with my son even though the night had been very dark before I turned on all the lights !! Even though the encounter lasted only a few minutes, I was frightened out of my wits but my instincts served me and I started the car, slammed it into reverse and hit the peddle hard. I didn't look back as I sped away east with a thumping heart.  I didn't even talk about this incident for several months, thinking no one would believe me and I may have dreamed it all - but the memory has never faded and I've never dreamed of strong smells before or since.  Over the next few years, I spoke with several people in the U.P. who have also sighted Sasquatch near or in the Hiawatha National Forest, but unfortunately cannot name them.",
