  "observed": "On my family's rural 3,200 acre se louisiana farm along the pearl river we found 16\" tracks in the sand dune from the lake then up a sand bank and over a flat area of sand, retreating down into the thick swamp. What startled us really wasn't the size but the stride! The stride was double our stride, the tracks appx were 8 ft apart!!! I believe in big foot and i know all we've ever seen was these tracks, but i know what i saw was not made by a human. My family has farmed this land since 1850 and never knew anyone to fake tracks. We keep tabs on who uses the property, mostly only family. We've heard strange sounds before, actually last was by me on nov. 15 2008 at 11:30 p.m. while hunting hogs at night. I thought it may have been a cougar, but after hearing similar sounds of primates, it may have been that type!",
