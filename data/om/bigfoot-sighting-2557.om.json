  "observed": "I was near Sabathday Point in the lake george region. I am not much of an outdoorsman so bare with me on the descriptions, terrain etc. After researching this area, I saw there have been a few sightings in this area. Which is why I am submitting this. It was aprox. 3:30am when I awoke. 2 friends and I were in a tent. 5 Other friends had a cabin about 1 mile from us. We decided to \"rough it\" as much as we could. I went outside the tent to make a phone call on my cell phone (I know, really roughing it) My brother gets off work at 3am. I needed to call him because I needed a ride in the moring. I was about 20ft from the tent. My friend yelled \"Im trying to sleep\" so I walked another 20ft from the tent. After I spoke to my brother I saw the time was 3:48. I then went to go to the bathroom. Thats when I heard a noise comming from in front of me. I was easily scared as I am not used to being in the woods very often. I stepped back a little and I saw aprox 60ft in front of me a figure comming up a slight incline in the terrain. My first thought was. \"Ok, bear in front of me run.\" as I went to run I noticed it had turned slightly and the one main characteristic I noticed was no snout like a bear would have. More like a human face although I couldnt see features. More of an outline. This really scared me. I ran to the tent and told my friends. They were sure it was a bear and we waited 10min before going back to the cabin. I later realized that this \"thing\" that I saw had a Human shape. I got a look at it for maybe 5 seconds. And like I said I am not much of an outdoorsman and probally wouldnt know a bear from an ape while in the woods....But what I saw was something unusual. It looked like a huge hairy man walking up a hill (fairly blunt but best way I could describe it). I was thinking it could be a bear on its hind legs, but It wasnt staggering. it was WALKING. The thought of \"Bigfoot\" didnt enter in my mind until a few days later and I have to say I dont believe in such tales that i see in supermarket tabloids. But, whatever it was, it sure was a unique experience.",
