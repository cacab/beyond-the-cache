  "observed": "I was asleep in my tent when something hit me. I woke up and realized that my tent was being bombarded by rock which I thought was being caused by one of my friends. I poked my head out of the tent because my buddy and I had forgotten to zip it. I looked around and I was about to pull my head back in when I saw a strange figure slightly in the brush staring at me. I yelled not knowing what to do and woke my buddy who was in my tent up. I proceeded to tell him what had happened and he didn't believe me. In the morning we proceeded to get up and investigate. We found no foot prints but the brush had obviously been disturbed, there were also several stones by the side of both tents that seemed to have been thrown there. Although we had planned to stay another night, we left promptly after I shared my story with everyone.",
