  "observed": "Honeymoon trip August 1991. Stopped at roadside rest between Redding, Ca. and Mt. Lassen. Wife felt ill in middle of night, walked her to restroom to throw up. While wife was in restroom I heard local dogs going crazy barking, etc. This barking was silenced by a yell that I've only heard on documentaries about bigfoot, but it is totally different live. After this yell, there was nothing but silence and my poor wife getting sick. I went back to the van and drove back topick up my wife. I told her I was just getting it warm for her, but she seemed to sense my aggitation. I convinced her nothing was wrong and we went back to sleep. I kept it to myself until morning. When I told her she didn't believe me. I saw nothing and smeld nothing, but I have never heard so much noise silenced so quickly.",
