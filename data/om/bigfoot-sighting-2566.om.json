  "observed": "Alachua County, Florida, around 1985 We lived in the country, with thousands of wild acres around our five acre plot.  While walking on  our paved road in front of our house one morning, I saw a creature cross the road about 250 yards from me.  I am a trained psychologist with a specialty in ready body language and knowing human gait and movement.  This creature moved more like an ape than a human.  He crossed at the small bridge over a flowing creek, and crawled down the side of the bridge into the creek and disappeared.  I ran over and went into the creek, only about a foot deep, to see if I could catch up with him, but there was not a trace. The very strange thing is that he was covered with green material, and it looked like leaves or palm branches from the sable palm.  Have you ever heard of a bigfoot doing this to make himself less visible in the woods?",
