  "observed": "In June of 2005 my family had a strange occurance.  My son and a couple of his friends wanted to camp out down in the woods.  My husband and one of the other boys' dad went down to check on them before we went to bed.  It was a full moon out and they were sitting down there with the boys when my husband saw something move between the trees.  He wasnt sure what it was and kept watching when he seen it move between the trees again he could see the moonlight between its legs.  They got scared and came up out of the woods.  Of course I didnt beleive him so the next day I went down there and found footprints.  One was a really good one that we actually poured a mold of.  Upon further scouting I found some odd things.  There was a bunch of little pieces of tree bark in a circle and it looked and felt like something might have been chewing on it.  We found moss rolled back, not tore up just rolled back.  And we also found tree limbs stuck in the ground kinda like markers.  Our friends didnt believe us so one nite we got a bunch of us together and went down in the same place my husband first saw it.  I had been interested so I did some research on the internet and took a little hand held recorder and recorded what was suppose to be bigfoot screams.  Around dusky dark my husband started playing the screams on the recorder he played them a few times and then all of a sudden we heard the god awfullest scream we've ever heard. It was high pitched and drawn out.  Everyone was shocked.  I dont know what it was but it wasnt too long after that, that a log, about the size of a piece of firewood came down out of the woods and landed by my vehicle.  After everyone got calmed back down we were standing around the fire when I thought I saw something just outside of the fire lite walking toward the creek.  I went and got back in my truck and about 2 minutes later it sounded like it picked up a creek rock and slammed it back down.  We all left after that.  The next weekend it was around midnite when my husband, my son and a couple of friends drove my truck back down there.  Without a fire it was really dark, they had a spotlight and my husbands' friend was just randomly shineing it through the woods when at the same time my husband and another person in the vehicle said, \"there it is\" so he brought the light back to the spot where they seen it, my husband instantly started the truck up and his friend told him to shut it off and when he did they could hear it running through the woods.  They said it was just trashing it way up the hill.  But they saw it when he brought the light back down through the woods, it was behind a tree and they said it had red eyes.  Another odd thing was that all the grass was laid down flat kinda like in swirls.  And there is nothing down there that would lay it down flat.  I've seen deer bedding before but this was a large area that was flat by the creek.  We still go back there sometimes and we haven't seen anything or any signs like we did that year.  Everyone thinks we are crazy which I probably would too if I hadn't experienced it for myself.  Anyways thanks for taking the time to read this sorry its a few years late but it came up in conversation again and I wanted to share my story.",
