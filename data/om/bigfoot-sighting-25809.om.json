  "observed": "I don't like talking about these things because, # 1 I don't believe in it and # 2 I do now. On Wednesday, April 8th, 2009 my cousins cows got out, which was located in Godfrey, Il. which is in Madison County. So I was walking in the woods up the road from their house about deep in to three acres of land and I cross this large valley and went up the hill and half way up I got winded. So I stop to catch my breath and as I rested against the tree I looked to the west from where I was standing to see if I could see any cows moving, which I did not. so I looked to the east and I saw a large man looking thing moving to the north in which as he walked tree limbs were breaking. Believe me I would be willing to take a lie detector test on this. This is the most shaking thing I ever seen. This thing had long black hair and very shaggy.  Thank you for your time.",
