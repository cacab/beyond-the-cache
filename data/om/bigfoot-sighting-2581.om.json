  "observed": "I and my former wife encountered three unusual events in a two year period, twice on horseback. [First two are detailed in a different report.] Thirdly, My former wife and a friend were riding a back trail to another friends house from the Hayfork fairgrounds after dark when my wife's horse alerted her that something was up ahead. She said \"hey, there's somebody up ahead', it moved diagonally towards us into the brush, was fast, silent and never made a verbal sound. It was very large a black silhouette that looked human (I even said howdy to it) it caught us by suprize so i wasn't spooked untill long after the event and I really thought about it. I thought it was a huge untalkative hippie right at the moment. Sitting on my horse I was at head level with it. My horse about 30 yrds. past it was the one that got goofy and spun around a bit. We proceeded through the woods to our friends house and never said anything untill the next morning at breakfast.",
