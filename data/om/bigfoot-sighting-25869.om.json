  "observed": "My girlfriend and I were fishing on Glen Flint Lake in Putnam Co. IN.  I would say it was about 1 am.  We heard a coyote, or coyotes barking and making yipping noises, then we heard several loud grunt like noises, almost moan like, very loud similar to what a bear sounds like, then a coyote let out a scream like sound, like it was getting hurt.  Then it got quiet.  I pulled up our anchors, and left.  I have camped all over the United States, I've camped in remote parts of Canada.  I have never heard anything like that.  I was actually a little scared.  Whatever it was it was big.  To this day I still believe it was a bigfoot.  If I had to guess, the coyote didn't make it.",
