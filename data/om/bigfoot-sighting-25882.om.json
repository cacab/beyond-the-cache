  "observed": "Me and a really good friend were up On Green Mountain, Which is 10 miles or so up Mt.Loop Hwy. When you go up the mountain you can either Go right at the fork in the road , or go left up the hill. We went left. We were going to this really  nice look out point, we were planning on camping out there for the night. When we arrived at the spot we set up our fire, and we were just admiring the view, I kept hearing noises like branches or twigs, or something of that nature popping and breaking. I just thought some deer or rabbits, then they started getting alot closer and very quickly. I started to get a little uncomfortable, My friend Pat is deaf so he didnt have a clue what was going on. He just kept asking me what I was listning to, and why I kept looking up the road. So Id say about 2 minutes went by I had heard nothing, But I had this strange feeling that something was watching us, I paid no mind to it. Then out of nowhere a stick came flying over top of the truck and went tumbling down the hill. OK now Im starting to get nervous, My friend pat still has no clue what is happening but he sees that im getting a little distressed, and Right As I was telling him what was going on. A rock about the size basketball, a little smaller smashed  hard right in front of our fire, I began to get very  very uneasy. I didnt notice any smell or anything, the wind was blowing at us, So he must have been downwind, We packed out of there in about 10 seconds and I have yet to return to green mountain. There was no explination of the branches or rock crashing or rolling down. there was no sound just all of a sudden a rock landed about 8 feet from us. ????? I dont know Im just very uneasy about going there again, and everytime I talk about it to people and all my  hair starts to stand on end..",
