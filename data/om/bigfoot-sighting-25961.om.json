  "observed": "[Editor's Note - Although the narrative is written by someone accompanying the primary witness, it is an important perspective to have, so I'm leaving the narrative intact. The investigator of this report spoke directly with the primary witness, and found this report to be accurate.] it was the summer of 86 i beleive when me my sister and couple other buddies used to go out at night running the backroads looking for old abandon houses to go through with flashlights .this for some reason was big fun for teens. anyway my sisters boyfriend knew of an old house in the woods on a dead end road that had the front door missing so we could just go right in and explore. we arrived at the old 2 story house with 12ft high ragweeds all around except a path to the front door,we all got out of the car and headed to the path to the front. i looked back for my sister and asked if she was comming she said no she would wait outside and took a few steps in front of the car,i think she was smoking a cigarette and us guys went inside the housewe wasnt in the house 5 min. when we heard a blood curlting scream come from my sister outside, we all bolted to the front door where we met her shaking and breathing really hard which rattled me because my sister doesnt run from anything and is tough as nails anyway this is what she saw.she was standing in front of her car 5ft from the 12ft rag weeds when the weeds started folding over from left to right with a very large black hair covered animal in the middle full tilt coming straight at her at an alarming speed she said it was hunched over running on 2 legs but bounding the weeds over with its huge arms she said when it was bent over with hands close to the ground it was still way taller than her. she closed her eyes and  screamed and at the moment of impacked it viered off and disapeared into the brush . The house is sill there today but there is now a fence with a lock and chain.",
