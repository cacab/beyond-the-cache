  "observed": "I am reporting a second incident which occurred in the same location as Report #3533 from 1998. This incident occurred in 99 or 2000. After the wood knocking incident from 1998 I made a decision to be as prepared as possible the next time I hunted my (now former) in-laws property. It was my goal to have a tape recorder and camera with me in case I was in the right place at the right time. That morning in late October I was heading into the woods for my first bow hunt of the year. I left the house around 4 or so with my gear and headed for the woods down the old logging road which lead away from the house. As mentioned before I had decided to carry with me recording equipment in case I had another opportunity to gather unusual sounds or video. To that end I was carrying my bow in one hand and a camouflaged bucket in the other (to be used as a seat) which contained the tape recorder and video camera, among other items. After leaving the house I walked fairly slowly down the logging road toward where it entered the woods. The road at this point was pretty clear of leaves and I was moving cautiously so as not to make unnecessary noise. I had progressed perhaps 100 to 125 yards from the house and was just about out of the light footprint from the yard light that hung above the house on a power pole when the scream occurred. I was caught totally off guard as I had barely left the house, was mentally checking off a list of my equipment and trying not to make noise. To say it made every hair on my entire body stand-up and froze me in place is an understatement. The scream occurred to my immediate left in the woods. I estimate whatever made the sound was no more than 100 feet (30 yards) away and slightly below me on the hillside. I could not see into the woods more than a foot or two, but the sound was so big and robust that I immediately felt it was coming from something much larger than me. As I was silhouetted against the skyline (from the perspective of whatever made the sound) at the far edge of the yard light I froze and listened. The sound began as a very low gutteral moaning which quickly escalated up the scale into a full blown scream. The sustained scream at the top lasted for probably no more than a few seconds when the it began to descend again to an inhuman low rumble. It all ended with a series of 3 low and gruff woofing noises. From beginning to end the scream was an unbroken continuous sound lasting perhaps 7-10 seconds. As I stood frozen I listened for any other sound and heard nothing. The scream was not repeated and I heard no leaves rustling indicating movement. The woofing noises at the end were very similar to those I have heard bears make (on television shows) when the are agitated - sort of a cheek puffing blast of air. I really doubt this noise came from a bear however. I cannot emphasize enough the way the sound projected. As mentioned above it was big and robust and just shattered any idea that something small like a black bear or coyote or human could have made it. I remember thinking if I were closer I would have felt the sound like it were being blasted from a set of huge speakers. Unfortunatley for me the my tape recorder was sitting useless in the bucket and the sound had come from the exact direction and location I was headed. My flight instinct was really churning, but I decided to head into the woods despite the chance I may encounter the screamer. I also decided that I might be better off heading in the opposite direction of the scream, which I did. Nothing further occurred.",
