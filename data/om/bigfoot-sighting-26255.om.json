  "observed": "Me and my friend were going back on a service road at Mud Mountain Dam In Washington State near Enumclaw, WA on Mud Mountain Road. We walked down the road and it slopes down and to the right. On the right is a hillside that goes straight up and to the left was a hillside that goes down and at the bottom is a circular area that is dry and wetlands. I looked to my left as I neared the curve in the road and what I believe to be a bigfoot was crouched down getting water from the swampy area. It then snapped its head over really quick looked at us and then stood up. It had to have been around 8 feet tall. It was a brown red color, darker than a mountain lion. I ran as fast as i could back to my car. I looked back and my friend had seen it and he was right behind me. I have been back many times and have never seen anything again but I will never ever forget what I saw. I am reporting this so many years later because my friend recently saw something a few miles up 410 near scatter creek and I know there is something in that area!",
