  "observed": "Tonight me and my husband were driving on Hwy 50 and we noticed a 8 to 10 foot hairy creature on the side of the road just standing there looking at us while we were driving home... We have driven that Highway enough to know that this was not usual thing to see. We have seen several deers only, but I couldn't believe what we just seen... I will never drive that Highway at night ever again... It really scared me... I am just curious if any other drivers noticed this big creature on the side of the road.. The time was between 10pm to 10:30pm on July 11th, 2009.  It was on the side heading toward Sacramento, CA. It was 3 to 5 miles between Silver Fork and Twin Bridges..",
