  "observed": "We were camping out with a couple of my cousins along with their kids on 4th of July weekend at Wheatfields Lake, east side of the lake. We got there on Friday evening which is July 3rd. we decided to camp there since there were alots of campers at the main campground which is located on the west side of the lake right off the highway. At 4:00am Saturday morning, my little boy woke and I started to tend to him. At 4:15am, my girlfriend and I were up sitting inside the tent feeding my little boy when we heard a loud low sounding roar coming near the west side campground. Immediately, some of the campers' dogs started to bark like crazy. I asked my girlfriend \"did you hear that?\"  she replied \"yes, what is it? It sounds scary\". I told her that its something huge with a good set of lungs. We heard it about 5-6 times. Duration of the calls would last like 10 seconds long. About 5 minutes later, the call ceased. But we could still hear the dogs barking away. Then at 4:45am, we heard one more call from the same location. Afterwards, my girlfriend and my little boy went back to sleep while I stayed awake all morning. The next morning, I asked my cousins if they heard the calls and they said they didn't.",
