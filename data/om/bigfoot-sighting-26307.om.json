  "observed": "The weekend of the 11th and 12th I went on a day hike at Old Forge campground just inside Cherokee national Forest. The trail heads East up into the Appalachians. On the Round Knob trail I noticed a 13-14in print that looked very human like. I could only see 4 toes but it appeared there was probably also a fifth. There's lots of moving water in the area, but I didn't see much in the way of wildlife. The next weekend on the 18th I made another trip with a friend and walked the same trail. The print had been washed away so he didn't get to see it. We got back to the campground and started a fire and just relaxed. At about 10:30pm we turned in. I couldn't sleep very well, I fell in and out of consciousness all night. As I was laying in my tent listening to the snores and quiet I heard 2 wood knocks to the East and a few minutes later 1 wood knock from the West. I told my friend about it in the morning and suggested we come back and investigate another weekend.",
