  "observed": "I was driving home from  work at about 11:00pm. As I rounded a curve in the road I saw something walking across the road in front of me. It was tall, not slim but not thick and covered in grayish - brownish hair. It never turned to look at me and just loped across the road and off in the dark. I was traveling about 40 mph and slowed quite a bit to ensure it would make it across without me hitting it.",
