  "observed": "I live in a very rural area of McDowell Co. West Virginia. It is not unusual to see bear, coyote, deer, etc. on a weekly basis around my home. I am an avid hunter/outdoorsman, and I have seen and heard (up to this incident) everything the woods of West Virginia have to offer. On July 23, 2009 I was setting on my front porch area of my residence (I had built a fire) at approx. 11:30p.m when I heard a loud \"scream\" from 150-200 yards away. My dogs immediately began barking in the direction of the noise. I assumed it was a mountain lion. I listened intently for a few more minutes but I heard nothing else. After about fifteen/twenty minutes, I heard something walking through the wood line directly across the road from my house. The crashing brush led me to believe that it was a large animal, possibly a bear. At exactly 12:15 a.m (fifteen minutes after midnight) I heard a loud roar or moan come from across the road from my house, approximately 300 yards from my house. The animal then proceeded to moan again, however this time, I also heard a growl. After the second moan, I then heard what I can only describe as a series of moaning howls. The howls sent a cold chill up my spine. I am avid hunter, and I know that the animal responsible for these noises had to be extremely large, at least 800-1000 lbs. I went inside and locked my doors. I am confident it was not a coyote, bear, mountain lion, cow, etc. This animal had a distinct, powerful moan that could never have been made by any of these animals.",
