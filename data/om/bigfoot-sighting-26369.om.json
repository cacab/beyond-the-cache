  "observed": "My husband and I were on our way home late one night when I saw the headlights of the car shine on something crossing the road.  I shouted to my husband \"DID YOU SEE THAT?\" He said, \"See what?\" I was all excited and couldn't believe that he didn't see it, but he had a good reason, he was focused on the steep hill and curve we were about to drive up and it was late and dark out.  We drove down Cherry Street in Germantown that turns into Diamond Mill on the outskirts of town. There is a fork in the road at Little Twin Road.  We go this route frequently when we go to my mother's in Middletown from our home off of Diamond Mill located on the outskirts of Farmersville and we come home the same direction.  We were on the way home when I saw this creature.  I was in total shock that night when I saw something really tall with long straight hair all over, dark rusty brown, and had a long stride as it crossed the road.  I was trying to see if it were a hunter dressed in some hunting outfit, but then remembered that it was March and NOT hunting season.  I told others of this sighting and was made fun of repeatedly until my neighbor just told me this morning of seeing the bigfoot in the same area.  I was elated that finally someone else saw what I saw in the same location!  I now travel with my camera ready in that area!",
