  "observed": "Approximatly 1992,a friend and I were hiking in the Los Padres National Forest,out of Frazier Park,CA.We were in the Sheep Camp area,and had stopped for a break near a rocky outcroping. I had walked away from where my friend Al was sitting,and was looking down into a ravine about 150 ft.below me.The area is heavily wooded, but as I stood there,I spotted a slight movement in the flora. I was startled to see something that was dark brownish and vertical,(since I would have clearly seen any horizonal part of it's body,from my vantage point.)I yelled for my friend,\"Hey!Al!Come here!\" Unfortunatly, he was tired and very uninterested...\"Whaaaat?...\"Come here! What the Hell is THAT?!!\" At my yell,the thing looked up at me. It had been standing sideways from my view,and cocked it's head up and to the rear on it's right side.I could see it had a face,not too unlike a human. Then it took off thru the brush,before my friend got within ten feet of the ledge. He did not see a thing! I did not detect any odor,as I understand is sometime reported,but it was down in a ravine.I have hiked extensively thoughout the Sierra Nevada Range and all over for the past 25 years,and have never seen anything like that.",
