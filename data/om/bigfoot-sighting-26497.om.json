  "observed": "ok, I'm 34 so what I'm about to tell you , I am still having trouble accepting, I've wondered about this since I was little. Now I KNOW,..... August 25, 2009 my girlfriend, her two boys and I went camping at my usual spot. This location was picked due to the isolation factor; it's 10 miles up logging roads near Estacada, Oregon. I will not disclose the GPS cords. or even close to prox., This is MY spot. Nothing abnormal occured over the day or night of the 24th, and the day of the 25th was normal events like gathering wood for the coming night. We had put the boys down for the night just after sun down. We were hanging around the fire chatting and poking the fire. Being who I am, I began making noise to hear it echo through the trees. You know, rooster noises and some whooping, basic idiot noises (approx. 1130 pm). I do this at times to keep bigger game from coming through camp. Well, I got one hell of a shock about 15 minutes later. We were walking back toward the fire from the truck, the fire was only bright glowing coals at this point, and BOOM, shock to the system!!!! Out of the pitch black night....one of the most unreal sounds I've ever heard in my life came rushing through the dark. It was a hair stiffening scream that at that moment I couldn't match in my memory of noises over the 20 years I've been going into nature to escape. This was the first time in my life that I felt a need to get out of nature, QUICKLY. The sound pushed through the trees like the trees were not even there. Even the air around us seemed to vibrate. From experience I have had in the woods through my life, and tracking sounds and distance, I'm estimating that this scream was being produced about 200 yards away. It was so loud that nothing I know of could make this big of a noise. There is no animal I have come accross that has the lungs to produce such a loud, long and vocalized sound as this \"creature\" produced. Let me put it this way....if someone told me they heard it, I would be trying to put a K9 responsible, but hearing it myself and knowing of nothing I've ever encountered could make that sound. Now, I did not stand there much longer. I think I may have pushed my girlfriend up into the truck so I could get in ASAP. As soon as I was in, the lights were on and the horn going for about 3 seconds to try to keep it from getting closer. It seemed to work because the volume started to fade a bit. We decided to get camp up and get out. over the minutes it took us to completely tear down camp, maintain a track on movement of the screams and shove camp into the truck, the screamig continued and moved. From the time it started ,it was at 2 o'clock from the camp. While we were packing up, it moved clockwise around to about 5 o'clock from camp.  This all took about 30 minutes before we were on our way down hill. The screams continued even on our way out. To make it completely clear, I've done alot in my life. Anything from solo hunting at the age of 12 and up to my time in the military, Iv'e never been spooked even with rounds wizzing past.....BUT that scared me to the point of every hair from the top of my toes to the top of my head were at attention! Now, after the fact, realizing what it was.....YES, I am going back with recording gear. Let me tell you, after 34 years just now experiencing what we did has completely changed my thinking process while out in these woods.",
