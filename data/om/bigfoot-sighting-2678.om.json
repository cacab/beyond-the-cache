My brother-in-law was turning off rt. 11 onto the raymond road when he said \"do you see that?\" and I said what and he said \"that big hairy thing in the bushes!\" It was off to the left about 100 feet in the woods and big and hairy, I mean real big. We only caught a glimpse of t in the headlights. This is more comon than you may think, people up hear see this stuff often but the locals keep it quiet. I know of several other reports from this area.",
