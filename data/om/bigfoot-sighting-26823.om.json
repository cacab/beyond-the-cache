  "observed": "Me and my 17 year old son were hunting at richloam wildlife management area. we had been walking through  the swamps all morning and on various occasions there was a really fowl smell that would come and go. At that time I just figured it was the swamp. When we got out of the swamp we were thirsty so we decided to run to the store since we had some time before we went to where we were going to hunt the afternoon. While driving out to the store we came around a curve in the road there was something really big that stepped half way behind a scrub oak alongside the road. I was only going about 20 MPH and as we went by we got a good view of what it was or at least what it looked like, as I hit the brakes while I was watching the thing in disbelief. I was going to ignore what I saw but my son started asking me what that was and he started discribing it and he had seen the same thing I had seen, so I couldn't ignore it. It was about 7 1/2 ft. to 8 ft.tall, about 3 1/2 ft. to 4 ft. across the shoulders, covered with dark brown hair with a redish tint standing on two legs. it looked to be fairly muscular. the face which was covered with short hair. we were able to see its eyes which were dark. the nose was flat and wide, and the mouth was wide but in  proportion to its head.",
