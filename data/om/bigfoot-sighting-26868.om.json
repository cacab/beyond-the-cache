  "observed": "i was looking through binoculars scanning for elk and saw what i thought was a man walking down the path on the mountain .  Thought it was unusual he didn't have on any hunter orange on.  It then turned sideways and I noticed it was bigger than a normal man walking with a long gate and was brown, almost the color of elk fur, was walking on two feet rather fast.  It walked to the ridge and looked over valley , then walked up same path it came in.  It was clearly visible because of snow in background, then it disappeared",
