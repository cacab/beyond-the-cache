  "observed": "I had just dropped my father off at his home at 1:50 AM in De Soto Missouri as I made my way down from Highway B onto NN heading north to my hometown Pacific MO. I was taking my time down NN traveling at around 30 mph to avoid any deer collisions due to the fact it is deer season.  I had seen frequent deer so I am very keen with knowing what animals in a field look like, especially through the peripheral vision of car headlights. I was about 5 miles from the Franklin County line when I saw a rabbit dart across the road and I slammed the brakes to avoid hitting it. I was at a 5 mph rolling stop when I looked where the rabbit had run from and I saw a 7 to 8 foot tall ape like animal running on it's hind legs at my vehicle as if it were aggressively charging at me. I did not get a look at it's face other than the clear outline of the creature. I was very frightened at the site, and the sense of knowing it was an animal not native to Missouri, and it had just made me start to reconsider what I had just seen. I have recently heard of the Missouri MOMO, and I have been very skeptical about it. I would like to know what animal in Missouri could run at that speed on it's hind legs, surely a Bear cannot. I also cannot understand why I would have angered a Bear in anyway from just stopping in the road. I debated on whether or not I should report this, because a lot of people treat you like an idiot when you tell them what you saw. I thank you for taking the time to read my report. ",
