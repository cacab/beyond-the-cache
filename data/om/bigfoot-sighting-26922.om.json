  "observed": "At around 11:00 we started raccoon hunting at a public area known as Cardinal Marsh. We had a hunting dog, my girlfriend’s dad, her, and me. We were walking on a deer trail on the corner of an alfalfa surrounded by thick woods. We were hunting for a while when we started hearing something fallowing us and we figured it was maybe just a deer walking threw the woods but it continued to fallow us. Then we say a large black mass about 50 yards to the right of us about 6-10 feet in height so we shined it with the spot light for about 2 minutes and saw a large black mass standing there with reddish eyes staring back at us. After we saw that we just continued on our way fallowing the dog and then started hearing a strange grunting noise that we never heard before. As we walked the grunting noise fallowed us and we heard that thing fallowing us also. This continued for a good 15-20 minutes and it sounded like it couldn’t have been more then 100 yards away. After walking for a good 15-20 minutes we stopped to listen to the grunting and the dog came to us and started shaking next to us. We shined the light around us and saw the eyes 50 yards away from us again and the large animal just stood there for a good 10 minutes then shined the light around us and saw the reddish eyes again about 50 yards from us and the large black mass it stood there for a good 2-3 minutes while we shined it then we decided to go back to the truck. On our way back we could see the large black mass still about 50 yards away but it stopped grunting and just fallowed us so we loaded the dog in the truck and left because we were so scared",
