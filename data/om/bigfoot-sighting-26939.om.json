  "observed": "I was deer hunting in a small woods that bordered a swampy area.  The entire woods is on a 45 degree angle leading down to the swamp except the small bowl like section I was hunting in.  The spot is very thick with pawpaw trees which provide ample cover for wildlife till about mid November.  I was sitting in my tree stand about twenty feet off the ground.  It was after 5pm which is what I refer to as magic time because that is when the deer start to move in the evening.  As the last rays of light had begun to fall onto the forest floor two does shot out from the brush behind me.  They seemed nervious and kept looking back behind my tree.  I thought maybe a buck was following them so I nocked an arrow and prepared to see a large buck walk out of the brush from behind me.  Then it hit me, the ungodly stench.  It kind of smelled like garbage or like someone had lifted the lid on a septic tank.  It was awful.  Then a log flew out from the brush behind me and struck the tree I was in at the base.  I nearly soiled my britches.  I turned to look behind me and what ever it was it ran off busting through the underbrush and I never got a clear look at what it was.  It let out a bloodcurdling scream as it ran off.  I froze not believing what had just happened.  I waited for at least an hour before I got down to walk back to my truck.",
