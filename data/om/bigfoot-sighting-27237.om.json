  "observed": "The six of us, my boyfriend, my children, another couple and me, stopped at a boat rental tourist trap on Lake Livingston. The guys we were with went in and rented two boats for a couple of hours while we waited outside.While on the lake I felt like someone was watching me, I quickly turned around to look into the eyes of a large black hairy creature approximately 8 or 9 feet tall that was standing at the edge of the lake right next to the waters edge looking right back at me. Although I was staring right at the creatures face I could barely see its' eyes due to the extreme amount of hair. Its body was huge and block like. For a few brief seconds we stared at each other then suddenly the creatures turned to its right and took one step and went crashing through the trees which shook even the very tallest trees and sent the birds panicking into flight. Being stunned as to what I saw I hesitated to tell the others what I had seen. But I did tell the others and asked them to take me to where I had seen the ape like creature and let me out to see if I could see any footprints. They too had heard the creature crashing through the trees and believed that I had seen something and wouldn't let me get out and search for evidence.",
