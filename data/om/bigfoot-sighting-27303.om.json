  "observed": "look, i will say first that i really like this campsite and dont want a bunch of random freaks going up there to look for bigfoot or whatever. you guys are professional about this, it seems, so if you want to go there, no worries. but i'd prefer if you didnt give the exact location out. long story short, i was camping up there over this past weekend. heard something really weird on friday night. really creepy too. ive heard all kinds of coyote calls and this was not coyotes, im certain. not a bird either. not an elk, deer, no kind of big cat. couldnt be wolf because there arent any wolves around here. didnt sound like a wolf anyway. i dont dis-believe in bigfoot, not a cynic or anything. so if someone more informed than me listens to these recordings and tells me its a coyote then okay, great. but this was WEIRD. it was NOT a canine type sound. anyway, i was in the tent when i recorded the sounds, so there is static, but you can still hear pretty well. i will upload them to my computer tomorrow and send them to you guys if youre interested. the main reasons im reporting this are that 1. it was really weird, 2. i searched prescott bigfoot on the internet and saw the report from the other couple you have on your site. i listened to that ohio howl, it doesnt sound like that. but anyway. im no expert, so if you guys are interested let me know. ps. my writing is kinda all over because im super tired. but the first thing i did when i got home was to start researching this, thats how freaky the sounds were.",
