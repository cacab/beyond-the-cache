  "observed": "BACK IN THE SUMMER OF 1977,MY HUSBAND AND I WERE LEAVING HIS UNCLES HOME LATE AT NIGHT.WE WERE IN THE AREA OF MENDEM,N.J.(I BELIEVE THIS IS THE CORRECT SPELLING.)WE WERE ON A VERY REMOTE DIRT ROAD.WE HAD MADE THIS TRIP TO MY HUSBANDS UNCLE NUMEROUS TIMES AND I ALWAYS ASKED MY HUSBAND TO LEAVE THE INTERIOR LIGHT ON IN THE CAR,BECAUSE IT WAS THAT BLACK AND SOME HOW,I FELT SAFER. THIS ONE NIGHT AS WE LEFT,WE SLOWLY WENT ALONG THIS REMOTE TRAIL SLOW AS USUAL WHEN SOME THING CAUGHT OUR EYE.\"IT\" CAME FROM THE FRONT LEFT DRIVERS SIDE OF THE CAR,STOPPED DEAD CENTER IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR CAR WITH OUR HIGH BEAMS ON IT,AND THEN CONTINUED TO MOVE QUICKLY TO MY RIGHT INTO THE WOODS AGAIN. THIS HAPPENED SO QUICKLY,BUT MY HUSBAND AND I STOPPED THE CAR ALITTLE FURTHER UP TO ASK EACH OTHER WHAT WE JUST SAW.JUST FOR YOUR INFO,I AM A BELIEVER,AND MY HUSBAND IS THE SKEPTIC IN THE FAMILY.HE SAID EXACTLY WHAT I HAD BEEN DESCRIBING TO MYSELF: ABOUT 6 FEET TALL.HAIRY BROWN,WITH UNUSUALLY LONG ARMS THAT SEEM TO SWAY MORE LIKE AN APE.WHEN IT STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF OUR CAR,IT'S FACE LOOKED MORE APE/MONKEY LIKE THAN HUMAN HOWEVER FEATURES WERE THERE THAT MADE IT APPEAR HUMAN LIKE.IT RAN/WALKED QUICKER ONCE IT SAW US. THIS HAPPENED SO MANY YEARS AGO,BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY TO US. MY HUSBAND IS NOW A BELIEVER BECAUSE HE WITNESSED SOMETHING VERY STRANGE.MANY MANY YEARS LATER WHILE BROWSING THROUGH A NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE,I SPOTTED A PHOTO OF SOME PRIMATES.ONE IN PARTICULAR WAS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW THAT NIGHT IN NEW JERSEY. I AM NOT ONE TO WRITE IN,AND EVEN AFTER WE TOLD MY HUSBANDS UNCLE WHAT WE SAW THE FOLLOWING DAY,HE LAUGHED AND SAID IT WAS PROBABLY A BROWN BEAR.WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT BEAR,BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BEAR WITH ARMS THIS LONG SWINGING THEM SIDE TO SIDE. SO WHAT WAS IT? MAYBE SOMEDAY WE WILL FIND OUT. I AM SHARING THIS EXPERIENCE WITH YOU BECAUSE WHAT WE SAW BACK IN 1977,WAS SIMILAR TO A \"BIG FOOT\" THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL WE HAVE EVER SEEN,OR READ ABOUT.WE'RE OLD ENOUGH NOW TO TAKE A GOOD \"RIBBING\"FROM OUR FRIENDS,BUT IN 77,WE BASICALLY TOLD VERY FEW PEOPLE WHAT WE SAW THAT NIGHT. THANK YOU.",
