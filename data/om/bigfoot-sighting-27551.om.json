  "observed": "(night before) me and my boyfriend went riding around out near the farm its just a old country road. i got to thinking and ask him if we locked the gate back at the farm, we went earlier to feed the cattle. he paused for a few seconds and looked at me and said i dont know, since we are close to the farm pull up at the neighbors new house and park in their drive way and ill run and check the gate. the gate isnt but a few feet away from the neighbors house. this house was still getting finished they had a big pile of gravel in the drive way were they werent done. i had my lights off in the drive way i looked back at him and i had the window cracked bout a inch this weird smell came through the window. then like a growl or grunt noise came from the front of the car. i turned on the lights i seen this big thing standing behind the gravel pile with one hand proped up on it and leaning over it with its big eyes and it had really long blackish brown hair. i started to hollar for my boyfriend and told him to get in the car. he asked me whats wrong what is it? i never freak it takes alot to scare me like that and he knows it. i notice him looking over to the right of the gravel pile and asked if i heard the noise. i told him what i saw and he asked if i was sure and i told him yes. i asked if we could go and get down the road and to leave it alone. we got bout 2 miles down the road and he turned and looked at me and said i saw something big running down toward the road, are you sure it wasnt teenagers out here. i told him i know what i saw and i want to head home. we went home the next day he had to help his step dad at the farm. (next day) we went to his moms house to meet up i stayed behind with her and told her what i saw. as the hours passed by we started worring bout them we called and text but no reply. bout 9 they walked throught the door, and they had a look that is hard to describe and my boyfriend looked at me and his mom and said u wont believe what we found and i have pictures. he opened his phone up and there was a perfect pic of a huge footprint and he said it was fresh they were out in the feild and heard a big crashing noise down the hill from them and they went to go see what it was and they found the prints and u can see in the others that it slid down the hill or it lost its footing. his mom looked at me and said so its real. and i said yeah.",
