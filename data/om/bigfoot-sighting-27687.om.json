  "observed": "On a day after the snow had fallen, we went hunting up in the Lake Hughes area in California. There were 4 of us hunting that day; my dad, and myself and 2 good buddies. Well, the deer hunting was not that good that day so one of my buddies said to us, my wife's uncle is gone from his cabin and won't be back any time soon, so why don't we visit his land and all and just hang out and all and have some lunch. Well, he lives by Lake Hughes's road and close to where we were. We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this, we heard the horses behind the house or cabin, running around and making all kinds of noise. We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But, man were they going nuts!!!  So, we all said to each other, let's get over there and see what's up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print's and smelled something like a dog that's been wet and rotten egg's mixed. Well, the gate was locked and he went inside the cabin or house and got a key for the gate. We went over to the prints, and I'm 6-5 at that time, and weighed 275 lbs. I have a shoe size of 15 4-E. These tracks were much bigger than my shoe and they were made, with some of them in the snow.  I stepped next to them and could not press down and going that deep! I could go maybe 3/4 - 1 inch down. These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider. Then I tried to step that far with my step, and no way could I. Then we followed the tracks until they came to this really steep hill. There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that, even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape, could not climb. I could not even lift my leg that far, and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don't walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was, it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods, and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs. I never seen it, but we got scared and left that ranch. I have told this story to a few people, and they look at me like, it could be, but you can tell, they don't think this is real.  But, when you see things like this, you just know something is out there. Nobody could change my mind on this one as, I know what I seen and it was not set up as, nobody knew we were going to his ranch, and the next ranch over, nobody was home there either. So, the only thing that could be is, this was real and not faked. Nowhere did we see any human foot prints by any of these tracks or up that steep hill. I know something is going on up there. N. F.",

I don't know where it is really, but, I do know it was in the lake Hughes area and we turned off of Lake Hughes's road to get to his house or ranch. My buddy was the post Master of Alturas, Ca, and has retired from there now. I have not spoken to him in a long while. We got lost from each other in life's struggles. LOL. He would know of this place and all. My dad does not remember either. This was a long time ago, and I will never forget it.  Ever!",
