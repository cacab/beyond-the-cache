  "observed": "it was spring 1981 and I was driving around some country roads with a friend listening to music when the tape jammed. I pulled over to fix it but left the car running & headlights on. I looked up from the tape & saw the bushes moving on the opposite side of the road,I assumed it was deer. I was wrong. I started to fix the tape again when my buddy said \"what the hell is that\" I looked up to see a very large gray haired creature stepping out of the bushes. It walked on 2 legs like a man,was around 5 or 600 lbs & stood over 7ft tall. I'm basing the height on my buddy with me who was 6ft 8in tall. It walked out into the road about 15 yards in front of us & just stopped & looked at us for a few seconds then just walked across the road into the woods & started up a hill. it had human like hands,feet &face covered in long gray hair.",
