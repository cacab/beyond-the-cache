  "observed": "My name is J. M., and my friend's name is R.S., and we were hiking about a mile above Sand Canyon, near Tehachapi, California, he lost his prescription sunglasses, and we split up to search for them. As I was hiking, I saw a very strange track. It looked human, but it was larger than any human foot print. Also, unless a human was walking a mile from the road barefoot through rough terrain, so it couldn't have been human. I met up with R.S., and on the way back I showed him the print. He is an Army veteran from Iraq and an avid hunter, and he was simply shocked by that footprint. He said to me, \"J. look, you can even see the toe prints! This creature has to be at least 7 feet tall!\" We looked at each other. I asked him, \"How old do you think that print is?\"  He answered, \"It looks to be about 3 days old.\" We both decided, after finding his sun glasses, we should head back to the car, while keeping a VERY sharp look out for anything strange. After we had reached home, it started to snow. We both realized it was very fortunate that we got to see that, because the snow would have wiped it out.",

You go for about a mile up Sand Canyon Rd. and then turn left off of this road and onto this unmarked dirt road for about 1/10 of a mile, or until you get to the area where people bring stuff out to shoot for fun. We hiked north east from that area, into the hills.",
