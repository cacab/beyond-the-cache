  "observed": "I saw what could only be described as a bigfoot several years ago on route to Kennedy Meadows.  I was driving up the dirt road past Grumpy Bear's place and not too far from Kennedy Meadows--maybe a few miles--where we were later camped.  I believe it was around Memorial Day, 1986-88. The sun was setting, and as I looked to the west to glance at it as it began to dip below the mountains, I something caught my eye out in the desert, among the Joshua trees.  At first I thought it was just a Joshua tree; but it was moving the same direction as I was driving--north.  I slowed, and watched it as it ran.  It was probably 100 yards? or so from me. I could tell it was big and tall, had long, dark brown hair.  Its arms were longer than a man's and I could see the hair flop up and down as it ran.  Its legs appeared to be very muscular and I was impressed by the ease in which it ran--its movement reminded me of a tiger, strong and graceful, although he ran on two legs like a human.  I saw it's head turn towards me, and I got a chill as I thought this thing is making eye contact with me!  Although I felt fear, I also felt it felt fear towards me.  (Don't ask me to explain this, but that's how I felt and I am an intuitive person!)  This was all in a matter of seconds--maybe five.  I turned to my passenger to relate to her what I saw, slowed down some more, but when I looked again to point out the bigfoot, all I saw was Joshua trees and desert.  I felt he was hiding from me. It was really an incredible experience, one that I will always remember. I didn't stop the car, climb the fence or go after him.  I continued to drive on to the campsite where I told my experience to the rest of the group. A few weeks to a month later, I remember seeing in the Bakersfield Californian an article that a bigfoot was spotted in the Shirley Meadows Campground.  As I understand it, that's not too far from Kennedy Meadows.",
