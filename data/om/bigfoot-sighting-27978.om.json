  "observed": "My girlfriends and I were horseback riding, on a moonlight ride when a strange sound stopped our chatter and the horses’ forward movement. All the horses stopped, raised their heads and trained their ears on the sound coming in front of them.   From up on a hill in front of us came a guttural growling sound with vowel sounds mixed in with the growl, as if coming from one source, not two separate animals.  While this sound was occurring we heard the distinct sound of snapping of wood.  Someone stated “get out of here” and we all galloped back to the farm where we were staying for a sleep over.",
