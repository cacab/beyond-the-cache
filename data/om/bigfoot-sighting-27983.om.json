  "observed": "During the summer of 1974 my sister in law I am were on our way from Lompoc, California to see our respective grandmothers. My sister in law's grandmother lived in Buttonwillow which is in Kern County, and my grandmother lived in Porterville, which is in Tulare County. It had just grown dark by the time we were about five miles outside of Paso Robles still in San Luis Obispo County on Highway 46 heading toward Shandon, and had just passed a lone farmhouse to our left when I had to pull to a quick stop. Just in front of us stooped down in the road and holding a chicken to its mouth was a creature about the size of a 12 year old. It stood up on two legs and ran quickly past us to the left of my vehicle, still holding the chicken. We turned to watch it veer off to our right behind us and up over an embankment. I asked my sister in law, \"Did you see that?\" She did. I don't know what I was thinking cause I then said to her, \"Let's catch it!\" and turned the car around. Then I immediately thought better of it, as it was obviously a young Big Foot, and I was afraid it's parents might be close by as well and with as fast as that creature ran, who knew the strength of its parents. This creature was covered with long dark brown hair except for its face and region around its belly button, and it was obvious that it was a boy. It had a flat face and a broad nose, and its teeth looked like it could use a good orthodontist.",
