  "observed": "I am writing this report for a family member of mine. The witness to the bigfoot was driving in her vehicle on her way home from work. The route she takes is all country back roads. She was going up a hill with her brights on and notices something was hiding behind a tree on the left side of the road. So she slowed down and it looked around the tree right at her and then poked back into hiding.The witness stated that it was very tall over 6ft tall and had red eyes and a man like face. The witness remembers going through her head questioning what it could have been and soon realized it was something, she had never believed in a bigfoot. She couldn't get over small little details from the little she seen of it. The height, color of eyes, and the way the eyes were set on the face, so human like, unlike an animal, and the face it self more flat like a human not pointy like a deer or bear. The thing that bothered her most was that it was intentionally hiding from her vehicle's lights and peeked out from the tree then hid once seeing her.",
