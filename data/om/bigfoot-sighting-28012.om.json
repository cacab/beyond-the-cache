  "observed": "I RECENTLY READ A REPORT ON YOUR WEB SITE. THE REPORT WAS DATED 11/30/2009 OUT OF CAMBRIA COUNTY. I WAS ALSO SITTING IN A DEER STAND IN THE PITCH BLACK AND POURING RAIN THAT MORNING. I WAS IN FOREST COUNTY WHICH IS NORTH OF CAMBRIA COUNTY. AND AS I SAT THERE I COULDNT HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE \"BABY BIGFOOT PICS TAKEN FROM A TRAIL CAM IN FOREST COUNTY IN 2008\" IT MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE UNEASY, BEACAUSE I BELIEVE THESE CREATURES EXIST AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. ONE MORNING IN LATE NOV.1988 I WENT DEER HUNTING NEAR MY HOME IN CLAIRTON. I DROVE DOWN RAVENSBURG BLVD. AND TURNED OFF TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD JUST BEFORE THE RAVENSBURG BRIDGE AND DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO CLAIRTON PARK. I DROVE ABOUT 100 YARDS DOWN A DIRT ROAD TO THE BASE OF A VERY STEP AND HEAVILY WOODED HILLSIDE.IT WAS APPROX. 05:30, IT WAS CLEAR AND VERY COLD, NEAR PITCH BLACK. I EXITED FROM MY VEHICLE. I OPEN THE REAR DOORS TO RETRIEVE MY GUN AND OTHER HUNTING EQUIPMENT. AS I TURNED AROUND I HEARD A NOISE APPROX 20 YARDS IN FRONT ME AND TO MY RIGHT. THERE WAS A HEAVY THICKET THERE. ALL OF A SUDDEN I OBSERVED I VERY LARGE VERY BROAD HUMANOID SHAPE RISE UP FROM THE THICKET. THE MASSIVE SHAPE DARTED TO THE LEFT IT MADE UP THE STEEP HEAVILY WOODED HILL SIDE IN A FEW SECONDS AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT. I WAS STUNNED,SHOCKED AND REALLY NOT SURE WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. I WAITED FOR IT TO GET LIGHT BEFORE I ENTERED THE WOODS. I SAT IN MY DEER STAND FOR THE REST OF THE DAY WITHOUT INCIDENT. I DONT USUALLY TELL THIS STORY BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK  I'M JUST MESSING AROUND WITH THEM. MY WIFE DOESNT EVEN BELIEVE ME. IVE HUNTED AND EXPLORED THESE WOODS SINCE I WAS 12 AND I HUNTED IN THIS SAME SPOT A FEW TIMES  JUST LAST SEASON. IVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON YOUR WEB SITE A SAW ANOTHER INCIDENT AROUND THE SAME TIME A FEW MILES FROM MY INCIDENT. WHEN A WAS A KID ME AND 3 FRIENDS WERE WALKING THROUGH THESE SAME WOODS WHEN SOMEONE STARED THROWING ROCK AT  US FROM A NEARBY HILLSIDE. WE JUST FIGURED IT WAS OTHER KIDS SO WE THREW ROCKS BACK AND CURSED. THESE ARE NOT BIG VAST WOODS THESE ARE LARGE PATCHES OF STEEP HILLS AND HEAVY THICKETS. BUT I READ ABOUT OTHER LOCAL INCIDENTS ON YOUR WEB SITE.",
