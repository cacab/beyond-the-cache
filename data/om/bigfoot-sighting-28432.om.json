  "observed": "It happened a couple nights ago. I was watching a movie in my room when I heard a noise outside. This was about 1 in the morning PST. It sounded like a long blowing horn, so I turned my TV on mute thinking it was a siren. I knew it was not a siren when I heard it again, and I knew it was coming from something alive. I went outside and the noise was so disturbing that I actually felt scared of it. It was more like this cry but in a howl, like it was hurt and moaned in pain by an injury. I have a few dogs, and each of them were very disturbed by it too. They refused to come near the front or back doors. It was like they didn't want to come outside. I assumed it must be a bear or a mountain lion, but the one thing that confused me was I don't think animals like them sound like that. The day after this happened, my friend came to pick me up around 8 at night. We enjoy going to casinos, and there is one about 35 miles from where I live. The sun had just set, and we drove maybe no more than 4 miles down the road when I heard the noise again. I rolled the window down more, and my friend heard it too. It was close to where we were, so we slowed down to get a better hear. The noise stopped, so we started driving again. About no more than ten seconds later we saw what looked like a 10 foot man, covered in hair. This is not a joke, and when the headlights shined on his eyes they glowed. Human eyes don't do that! He was pretty far from our vehicle, and no I didn't see his face. His hair was black maybe dark brown, and yes his eyes glowed by light! The first thing we both thought was bigfoot, but neither of us agreed. I did a little look-up on my computer and found information on bigfoot. The howling, and the sight of that animal could not have been a human, and if it were then he had some massive eyes with big contacts to make them glow like that. I am pretty sure the car behind us saw it too, because they slowed down and stayed behind for about a minute after we drove away. We went about our business to the casino that night after our encounter, and now I am a true believer and have decided to notify you about this.",

Find Peltier road and drive about 8-10 miles down until you find a bridge that is connected to Mackville road. Drive on it until you find highway 88. It takes you right to it. If you are coming from the south drive through stockton on freeway 99 until you find the off ramp for highway 88.",
