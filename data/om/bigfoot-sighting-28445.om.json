  "observed": "It was about 7:15am and overcast but had just stopped raining. I was hunting near Hugo, Oregon. I was about a half a mile from where I parked my vehicle walking on an ATV trail. It was still mostly dark and I had my flashlight in my hand but turned off. I was trying to be quiet as possible while walking quickly because I wanted to make good time to a favorite clearing without spooking any deer that may be in the area. As I was walking, I saw a very large animal walking upright in front of me across the trail at about 10 yards. It didn't appear to be running but expanded the distance of about 15-20 feet in two strides from left to right of the trail. It did so without making any noise that I can remember. I instantly froze and clicked on the flashlight. What I saw made my hair stand on end. I saw a large muscular dark fur covered animal that looked to be about 7 - 7 1/2 feet tall. I guess it would be around 500 lbs. I have seen a few bears and I know positively that it was not a bear. It was maybe 20 yards away from me and moving quickly down the hillside and into the trees. The entire encounter lasted just a few seconds. I don't believe it looked back at me so I don't know what it's face looked like. I was fixated on it's body. It never made any threatening movements toward me but I had never been that scared in my life. I quickly turned around and quickly walked back to my vehicle and left.",
