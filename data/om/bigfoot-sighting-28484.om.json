  "observed": "During the summer months of July and August my family has had a number of events that we have heard and seen what we believed to be a big foot here in Central Illinois.  We know he has left the area now.  The next year, in 2007, I saw a large off color black thing running across a field, I had my spotting lamp on it.  The thing we believed followed us home, we live a short distance from where we have seen and heard it.  There was a cornfield across the road from our house and three rows deep into the corn field there was a trail running parallel to our house and road.  Corn had been knocked down two to three rows. This ran approximately 100 to 150 yards.  My wife was home one day and heard something breathing very deep behind her while she was standing in the house.  The thing was outside the house looking into the window.  When she turned it was gone and she heard something running away.  It scared her.  The boys have went down into the area where we know he is during those months and have heard his scream and have come back scared to death.  One night we heard the scream coming from that direction.  We have asked the old timers in the area about what they know, they just don't want to talk about it.  They are very closed lip about it.  I know what I seen and I saw a large hairy thing running across that field. When I went after it, it was breaking branches in the trees.  It sound like it was hitting the branches together not like it was running or walking in the trees.",
