Stan - Can you please explain what you saw? Mark - It was my junior year of high school, so 2005, probably November. I was driving home on the back roads to the house. I saw a big black head sticking out the top at the corner of the corn field. And I stopped and saw this big black hairy thing. Then the head disappeared and a couple of seconds later it came walking across the road, and disappeared in the corn across the road. I took off then, I didn't even take time to turn and try and see it walking, I just kept going. Stan - How tall do you think it was? Mark - Eight feet to nine feet.tall. Stan - And what color was it? Mark - Dark, very dark brown. Stan - How was it built? Mark - Very muscular. Stan - How much would you think it weighed? Mark - Close to 300 lbs. Stan - Did it walk slowly or did it run across the road? Mark - It had a normal walking pace, it just walked across like nothing was bothering it. Stan - Did it look at you? Mark - It looked at me when I stopped, when it was sticking its head out of the corn. Stan - Were you able to see its face at all? Mark - No, I couldn't see the face.",
