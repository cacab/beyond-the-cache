  "title": "Wood knock and possible nighttime sighting east of Canton Lake",

  "observed": "I had been at my camper out past Canton Lake on N. Martin Rd. finishing a sculpture which was my project for the day. It had just gotten dark so I can guess the time. Having no flashlight I stepped into the road to begin the long walk back to Canton. I lit a cigarette and heard a small knock in the thin group of trees behind me. I turned, looked in the trees, seeing nothing I began walking. Down the road I went. It was a bit chilly. I knew walking would warm me up. I had just enough light to see the road ahead, the night sky was a shade lighter than the trees. About 10 minutes of walking I had just become more at ease with the night time walk when a great noise happened in the road ahead of me (about 30 ft.), like a cow falling into the loose gravel. I strained my eyes to see what it was.  A crumpled shadowy figure stood up. Human? I thought to myself, \"that must have hurt.\" Yet I hadn't heard any groan or speech during the fall. It walked calmly across the road. This is when its legs were seen, a lighter shade of road behind them. Biped for sure, but, too muscley. Some light glinted off the fur. It was animal. I know when I am seeing an animal, and not a snowsuit. Biped! I just seen sasquatch (a strange thin, tall, muscley one). And I still had to get on by where it disappeared into the shadows again. A house to the left had a garage light, which dimly lit up the yard, nothing crossed the yard. My impression was that thing ducked behind a bush and was still laying there when I finished walking by. I think these creatures are mostly nocturnal and curious, but they really just want to be left alone. I didn't want it to feel cornered or provoke a defensive attack, so I just kept walking.",
