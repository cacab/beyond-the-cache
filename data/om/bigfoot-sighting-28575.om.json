It was acting very confused or anxious. It walked slumped over and made three different trips from the edge of the cliff back to the tree line. The creature was brown in color. It was at a distance that i saw the creature. It seemed to be thin and tall. The lady in the doctors office seen it too. We attemped to point it out to other people in the office but it had disapeared into the treeline by then. I am not the type to believe anything unless i have seen it myself.I know what i seen.

I live in est tn. now and think of that eposode every now and then. i have told very few people about this.",
