  "observed": "I was camping on property I own on the Suiattle River in Washington state the weekend of August 28th 2010. When I arrived at my camp site and set up both my dogs began acting very agitated,the younger of the two never did settle down until we all went into our 5th wheel for the night. The next day walking down by the river I found foot prints in the mud, the foot prints appeared to come out of the river go about 50 yards and circle back to the river. I took pictures of these tracks and the next day I went to Darrington and bought some plaster and made cast. The size of the footprints are about 13 inches long and 4 inches wide we call them \"smallfoot\".",
