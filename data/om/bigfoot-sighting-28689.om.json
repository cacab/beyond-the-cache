  "observed": "My ex girlfriend and I were bored one day so we went for a leisure drive (she was driving) down old highway 94 in Callaway county Missouri. We were 2ish miles down the road when I see a huge brown object 20ish feet off the side of the road in the yard of a house that no one lived in.  I see a humanoid creature on it's hands and knees in front of a big round hay bale. left arm straight down, right arm extended picking up something off the ground. Right knee straight down, left leg extended as if to counterbalance itself. I saw it so clearly that I seen the expression on its face(soft looking, lighter brown hair on the face with a black nose)from a profile angle. It was totally engrossed in what it was picking up off the ground. From the extended arm I saw long darker brown hair maybe 12 inches long blowing in the wind. The hair was not matted and seemed to be clean and shiny. I quickly surveyed the surroundings to get a idea of the size of this thing. it's extended arm stretched maybe 2 feet in front of the hay bale, the extended leg probably 3 and a half feet the other way. It's back was flush with the top of the hay bale. I was unable to speak for a couple of seconds. When I regained control of my vocal cords I told my girlfriend about what I saw. She looks in the rear view mirror and seen the creature by the hay bale then exclaimed she was turning around! Some cuss words followed with the threat to throw her out of the car if she stopped. The creature didn't even seem to notice us or care about anything but what ever it was doing. we was in a small car (94 Mazda 323)and who knows what would have happened if we startled the thing and it came after us.
