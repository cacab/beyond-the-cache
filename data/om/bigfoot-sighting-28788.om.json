  "timestamp": 211593600,
  "observed": "Seen, Large 8'+ tall manlike hairy creature at a distance of 60 - 70' for between 45 sec. to a minute +. As I came through the head high brush it raised up behind a tree. I was clearly able to see it from mid torso up. F@\"/ing HUGE! All the sound turned to white noise and the tunnel vision took over. I have never felt more alive. Totaly focused on this thing. It was grey black, long hair that came down to meet masive shoulders. If you were to look at your typical doorway. It's shoulders would have extended a full foot beyond it's width and it's chin would have been the only thing seen below the celling. It had a dark brown face visable through it's hair. As I said I first noticed movement when I came through the brush into thfe clearing. It must have seen me and stood up for a better look. We locked on eachother and froze. I in amazement. I could not move. I was so fixed on this thing. I heard some children approching 50 yards or so behind me. Some protective instinct kicked in. I spun around yelling at my partner to \"GET THOSE KIDS OUT OF HERE\"! And I ran to head off the kids. I told my boss about it and after telling me that i looked like had seen a ghost, that there had been bear sign around. Bear my aunts fanny. I have been in the woods my entire life and I can tell you that there are things that go bump in the night.",
