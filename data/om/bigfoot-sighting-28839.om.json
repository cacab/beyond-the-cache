  "observed": "I live in rural part of Sevier County, Arkansas.  On 2/6/11 I went out to feed my dogs. They are tied out about 150 yards from my house. As I was feeding the dogs I noticed a large barefoot track measuring about 13.25 inches long and 5.5 inches at the widest part  and 4 inches at the instep.  I saw only one right footprint as the snow was melting quickly. I found another track west of the house about 300 yards from the first one. It was more melted so the toes were not as clear. Track was also right foot. I called my two grandsons to take the pictures with their camera and cell phones.",
