  "observed": "On October 22, 2010, I was driving home from work, it was approximately 8 pm at night, and I was driving on a country road out behind canton airport when my headlights hit something huge standing at the side of the road..my mind couldnt make sense of what it was, all I knew was the hair stood up on the back of my neck and I felt the need to get past this thing very fast..so I sped up..and it was just standing...right at the edge on the line at the side of the road towering...it wasnt moving..yet there was some sort of movement like the wind blowing something..I was so terrified that as soon as I got past it..I checked my rearview mirror and whatever it was was gone..the next morning in the light..I checked the whole area on my way past to work and there were no trees, as was suggested by friends..nothing but farm fields and a low hedgerow..I know without a doubt what this was..this was Stark County, Ohio.It was as if this thing was just watching, I know this isnt funny but it reminded me of the snuffaluffagus on sesame street..thats how huge it appeared..I called my daughter right away and had her talk to me until I could calm down. Ive had others say..it could have been a cow..or a tree..and I say..does a cow stand upright alongside the road just chilling and watching...and how does a tree move from a field onto the edge of the roadway?",
