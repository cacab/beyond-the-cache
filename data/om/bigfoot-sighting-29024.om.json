  "observed": "I LIVE IN FOREST CITY N.C. I HAVE NOT TOLD MY ENCOUNTER WITH BIGFOOT TO ANYBODY OUTSIDE MY FAMILY AND FEW FRIENDS. I KNOW MOST PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE NOT OUT THERE. I THINK THEY MISTAKE THEM FOR BEARS,WELL I SEE BEARS ALL THE TIME WHERE I WORK IN LINVILLE AT A RESORT. IVE SEEN THEM FROM CUBS TO 600 POUNDS.IVE SEEN THEM WALKING SITTING AND STANDING UP. I KNOW WHAT I SAW ONE NOVEMBER DAY ABOUT 3:30PM ON A SUNNY DAY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF LINVILLE RIVER ABOUT A MILE FROM THE LINVILLE WILDERNESS AND FALLS AREA WAS NOT A BEAR , THIS IS MY ENCOUNTER WITH BIGFOOT I WAS DRIVING MY TRUCK ON MY WAY HOME AND WAS CROSSING LINVILLE RIVER BRIDGE AS I DO MANY TIMES ON MY WAY FROM MY JOB I ALWAYS LOOK DOWN THE RIVER BECAUSE IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. THIS DAY WAS NO DIFFERENT  THAN ANY OTHER UNTILL I SAW A LARGE DARK CHESTNUT COLORED OBJECT STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER ABOUT 100 FEET FROM THE BRIDGE . I SLAMMED ON MY BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN BECAUSE IT STARTLED ME SO IT WAS STANDING SIDEWAYS FACING THE SAME WAY I WAS TRAVELING. WHEN IT HEARD MY BRAKES IT TURNED ITS HEAD AND LOOKED AT ME IT DID NOT HAVE POINTED EARS OR A SNOUT LIKE A BEAR. FROM MY ESTIMATION IT WAS OVER 7 FOOT TALL ITS HAIR WAS NOT LONG AND SHAGGY OR NASTY LOOKING , ITS FACE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE MUCH HAIR ON IT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.IT HAD A PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF A LARGE MAN, ITS LEGS WERE VISABLE FROM THE WATER TO ITS HIPS, ITS ARMS WERE LONGER THAN A NORMAL MAN THEY SEEM TO BE DOWN TO ITS KNEES FROM THE SIDE I SAW IT FROM WHEN IT TURNED TO LOOK AT ME ITS HEAD SEEMED TO BE EGGED SHAPED AT THE TOP AND ITS CHEST FROM THE SIDE WHEN IT TURNED TOWARD ME IT WAS COVERED IN HAIR. ITS HEAD TURNED ALL THE WAY TOWARD ME BUT ITS UPPER BODY JUST TURNED A LITTLE. ALL THIS HAPPENED IN THE MATTER OF 5 TO 8 SECONDS, WHEN I CAME ALMOST TO A STOP IT WENT OUT OF VIEW BECAUSE OF THE BRIDGE INBANKMENT I WENT A FEW MORE YARDS AND TURNED AROUND CAME BACK AND STOPPED BUT IT WAS GONE. I KNOW WHAT I SAW AND IT WASNT A BEAR.",
