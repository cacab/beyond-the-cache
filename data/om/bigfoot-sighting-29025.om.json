  "observed": "My name is (edited by investigator).  I am 51 yrs of age. I have been in Washington since 1959.  I am a mountain man and spent most of my time on horses in high country. I never saw big foot until one day when my son and I went to Tule Lake to do some fishing. We were on the bank fishing and he snuck up on us and watched us fishing but we couldn't see him. Then he walked on around to the other side of the lake. This lake is probably the size of a football field. He came out of the timber and there is a short spread of grass he walked through. Thats when we saw him. My son too I think.  He had taken up residence there for some time because all the animals left the area. It was high in all kinds of wildlife.  I saw him one other time not too far from the lake down on the Nisqually River.  My father saw him on top of Muck Creek hill. I use to tell my friends but they were very skeptical until they asked my son. That boy never lies. Then they were believers.  I am a very good tracker and have gone in look for him. I could hear him but he would stay down wind so I couldn't smell him. If you want to hear more, get ahold of me.",
