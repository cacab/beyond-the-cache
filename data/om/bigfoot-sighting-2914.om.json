  "observed": "My friend and I  were sitting in my basement watching T.V. when our pet goose started to make weird noises. we went outside and heard sticks and branches breaking, so we went inside and each grabbed flashlights. we saw a animal across the street from our house and we came closer. We were about 30 feet away and saw it was in the woods crouching down (sitting like a dog). We both noticed that it had long grayish brown hair, orange eyes, a big chest, and it looked like an above average ape or gorilla. every time we would take our lights off of it, it would move around looking nervous. when our flashlights were on the animal, it would freeze like a statue. After about 10 minutes of looking at it across the street in the ditch right on the line of the woods, our flashlights were starting to get dim, so we went inside to get my car keys so I could put my headlights on him. It took me approx. 20 seconds to get the keys and get back outside, by that time he was gone.",
