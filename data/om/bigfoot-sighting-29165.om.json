  "observed": "The evening of April 15, 2011 I was with fellow BFRO investigator Eric L. and BFRO enthusiast Sam. We were on a trail in the Shawnee National Forest southeast of Equality, IL.  We were using Sam's thermal imaging monocular (L-3 Comm. X200xp ). We had traveled on the trail up a slight incline and occasionally either doing a howl or some whoops. When we got to our point before we decided to turn back. During our return we started getting some return howls four to be exact over about a five minute period. This was confirmed by several others in our camp. Shortly after, on our way back to base camp, I saw a heat signature. This was rather a bright heat source, different from any of the deer heat source we had observed both before and after this. This \"Heat source\" was behind a tree first observed on the left side of the tree. It then disappeared only to reappear on the right side. This continued for about a minute or so and it was playing \"Peek a Boo\" more or less. During this observation Sam looked through them and all he said was \" Oh My God\". He said it was a squatch. Both Eric and Sam decided they wanted to move closer to the heat source. As they got closer to it, it got smaller and then moved from right to left through thickets or something. It then was gone. I was not able to make out any thing other than what appeared to be the head peeking out from behind different trees.",
