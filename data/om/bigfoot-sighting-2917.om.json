  "observed": "I was going for a drive. I had 3 kids with me, my daughters and one of their cousins. It was starting to get dark. I decided I wanted to turn around and not go all the way down to the sort yard. So I pulled into a turnaround. I had the car lights on. Just in the bushes on the other side of the road, I noticed some movement. I thought it might have been a deer, so I stopped the car. The first thing I really saw was really bright blue eyes. Then I noticed how far up they were, the thing had to be about 8-9 feet tall. The rest of the thing was real dark, might have been black or dark brown. My daughter saw the feet....they were huge. When I realized it might be a bigfoot, I freaked out and tore out of there. I've never been down there after dark again. I rarely go there at all. It didn't move after the initial movement we saw, it just stood there looking at us.",
