Last Weekend, A Group From Our Church, Went Up Into The Mountains, Near Graeagle, Ca. For A \"Big-Boys\" Camp-Out. Sitting Around The Fire At Night, The Subject Of Bigfoot Came Up. I Asked A Friend If He Believed In Bigfoot, He Said \"Yeah\", Then Told The Group This Story: He Told Us How His Friend, XXX, Had Gone Up To Marbel, Mountain Ca. With His Family To Camp. XXX Decited To Hike Around The Area Of His Camp, And Soon Came Across A \"Hut\" With A Big Doorway In Front, And A Smaller Doorway In The Rear. Upon Closer Examination, He Noticed That The Branches Used To Make This Hut, Were Way To Big To Be Broken, And Set Into Place By A Human. He Noticed That The Inside Of The Hut, Was Lined With Fresh Pine Neddles, And Sunken In The Middle Where Something Very Heavy Bedded Down. XXX Then Went Back To His Camp To Get His New Video Camera, And His Wife And Son. They Went Back Out To The Hut And XXX Began To Film The Hut, With His Son Going In Through The Doorway, And Out Through The Back Doorway, When His Son Said, \"Dad, There He Is\" XXX Turned Around And Saw A Tall \"Creature\" On The Adjacent Ridge, With Arms That Hung Down By It's Knees, Moving From Side To Side. The Bigfoot Seemed Confused, Wondering How He Was Going To Handle These Intruders, Checking Out \"His\" Hut! XXX Leaned Against A Tree, And Filmed About 5 Minutes Worth Of Video. He Offered To Show The Video, At One Of The Gatherings We Often Have. This Sighting Happened Around The First Of July, 2001. I Thought You Might Find This Account Interesting.",
