  "observed": "It was back in july of 2006 i was biking to a friends house because she was having people over. In between our house you can take the D that leads into Eau Galle or you can take C i believe or cc. Instead of taking the long way and the busy way which is D i took C. I biked up over my hill out of my driveway and down through the what is called the Eau Galle bottoms which is a swampy and wooded area. I was 3/4 through the swamp and i was nearing a knoll just as i neared it i heared sticks braking and what sounded like foot steps i looked off to my right and saw i tall black figure. I screamed because i was terrifed and then i heard the most bone chilling noise in my life. i pedeled as fast as i could and kept looking back to see whatever it was wasnt chasing me. i kept hearing the sticks braking and i pedeled as fast as i could my heart was beating like a mother ******. I got to my friend house and i told her and she wouldnt believe me i was dead serious with her and almost cried but she wont till this day believe me.I've only told my brother,mom and dad besides my friend and none of them believe me. To all people that have seen one know what i mean it is very frightening",
