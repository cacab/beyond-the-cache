  "observed": "This week, my roommate's parents, who live about 10 miles north of Russleville, went out of town for vacation. They left my roommate to house-sit, so we took the opportunity to play some video games on their giant 3d tv. While taking a smoke break outside, we all began to hear a moaning in the distance that was driving all of the local dogs crazy. Initially the calls were quite frequent, in groups of three or so, with maybe a minute or two of silence between each group of three. As the dogs would calm down, the howl became audible again. We couldn't identify exactly what we were hearing, like a siren with a growl in the lower register; but we were too far out of town for this to be any kind of emergency vehicle, or boat horn. We couldn't even decide that this was an animal any of us had heard before. As the night progressed, the howls became less frequent and farther away, though they maintained the repetitive grouping. My friends know me to be the bigfoot enthusiast of our group, but I wasn't about to try to confirm what we were hearing as a sasquatch call without some point of reference. When I listened to the 1994 Moaning Howl recording  from Ohio, I asked my roommates if it sounded familiar, all agreed; so, I'm posting this today.",
