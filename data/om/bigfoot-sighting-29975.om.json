  "observed": "I was driving near the Puget Sound in Washington in the spring of 1993. I had just dropped off my friend at her house and was driving home on a 2-lane rd. I looked down to change the channel on my radio and I felt something push the backside of my car into the other lane. I looked up, scared, and saw something larger than a person walking quickly into the woods away from the Sound. I was terrified and drove home. I got home and was sure that there would be a huge dent in the rear of the car, but to my surprise there wasn't even a scratch.",
