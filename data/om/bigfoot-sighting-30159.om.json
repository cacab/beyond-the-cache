  "observed": "It was winter of 1989.  What I saw scared the **** out of me.  Me, my sister and her friend found the keys to my brothers 4-wheeler and decided to sneak it out @ approx 10:30 pm on a snowy winter night. Nobody knew we were going to do this, so there is no way anyone could have been waiting for us in a costume or anything.  Plus nobody knew I even knew how to operate a 4 wheeler (including myself).   We headed out to the woods behind our parents house and half way down a steep hill the 4 wheeler took off flying and when I figured out what gear to put it in the 4 wheeler stopped and my sister and her friend jumped off.  I recall smelling something \"dead\" then I heard something that sounded like Monkeys (yes multiple) fighting.  When I looked towards the trees I see this huge monster walking out.  This thing was at least 7.5 or 8 ft tall and standing straight up with huge long arms and legs. As it was walking towards us it made a deep growling angry noise.  I took off on the 4- wheeler and my sister and her friend were running as fast as they could to catch up.  I looked back a few times and recall thinking- this thing is walking but one of it's steps was equal to 20 of mine.  We were in a panic we were all screaming and the louder our screams the deeper it's growl got. By the time my sisters friend had grabbed her arm and yanked her onto the 4 wheeler, it was within it's arms reach of us but never tried reaching out to hurt us. It was obvious he or she wanted us out of there.  I was only about 13 at the time so I wasn't wise enough to call someone to come research it.  I believe our parents just thought we were making it up.  And of course, I was way to scared to go back and track foot prints or anything.",
