  "observed": "While camping in the Sierra, several members of our group were awakened by  repeated screams very similar to the Klamath and Washington State sound files at bfro.net.  I first  heard the eerie bellowing screams at 4:45AM and they continued until 5:05AM, followed by another short series soon after .  I thought it was over for the night until a short series of screams began at 6:30... from a different direction.  The vocalizations were grouped in a pattern of 4 or 5 \"blasts\" (lung-fulls?) with a (resting?) pause of a few seconds followed by another series of 4 or 5, a pause, and so on.  This continued with only slight variation for 20 straight minutes; then the two other series mentioned above. While my wife says her heart was \"beating like crazy\", I was simply astonished. I've been interested in the bigfoot phenomenon for more than 30 years, so I had tears in my eyes as I paid close attention to this almost indescribable sound. To my thinking there are only two possibilities to explain these nocturnal screams: 1) Someone playing high-fidelity recordings at high volume at 4:45AM, or 2) A sasquatch was screaming out  at night in the forests of Calaveras County. Either way -- MANY other campers had to have heard what we did.",
