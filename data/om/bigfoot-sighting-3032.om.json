  "observed": "Five of us were sitting in a boat in the middle of Beaver Lake about 11:00 PM.  It was just before I moved away from the area, so we were getting together at our friend's lake cabin one last time before I left.  We were all talking and some coyotes started to yip and howl.  After about approximately ten seconds of this, we heard a low gutteral howl.  This howl was much lower and longer than the coyotes.  I said, \"did you hear that?\" and about that time this sound repeated two or three more times in succession.  Two of the guys dismissed these as howls of a Husky breed of dog.  One of these two owned a Husky in the past.  However, this sound was much deeper than the sound I heard his dog or the coyotes make.  It was almost exactly the same as the vocalizations I listened to on your website.  It was not the screeching vocalizations.  All the sounds appeared to be several hundred yards away.  After that, no more sounds were heard.  Neither the coyotes nor the other sound.  I believe these were sounds from a Bigfoot.  I did not tell of my suspitions, for I have only revealed my beliefs to the guy who owned the Husky.  I felt as though the others may not believe me or make fun of the situation.  It took me a while to get to sleep that night knowing that a Bigfoot may be in the area.",
