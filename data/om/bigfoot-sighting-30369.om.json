  "observed": "I took my kids camping at our camper and decided to do some sight seeing at a couple of places by the camper.  We went to a place called Fort Hill in search of a stone wall the indians built encasing 40 some acres of forest land.  It has not been touched since then.  While hiking on the paths we seen what looked to be a bigfoot print in the mud on the path that we was on.  It was about half way up a 400' hill we was climbing.  While we was hiking, we heard a big crash that sounded like a tree falling and also had something follow us through the woods for a while.  We never seen anything but could hear twigs breaking and leaves shuffling.  I did take a picture of the print with my daughter's foot next to it.",
