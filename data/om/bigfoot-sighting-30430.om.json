  "observed": "It was later June when I was going to the camping trailer to go to the bathroom I saw something out of the corner of my eyes as I was opening the door I looked to the left where I saw this creature walking upright and while it was walking it turned at the waist and his head a little to look at me I guess it heard the trailer door but it was maybe 7 or 8 ft tall I have a pic of a foot print from the back of my property on my cell phone with my foot next to it. I couldnt believe my eyes.  I didnt tell my husband for two days. we also have something like a bedding area it was staying in I do believe. I dont know anything else that would have done that a tree snapped up high.",
