  "observed": "Monday (Aug. 15, 2011) morning approximately 5:10am, I was traveling North towards Jacksonville, NC at 50 miles per hour.  The road was straight for 3 miles, it has forest on one side and swamp land on the other side.  Approximately 5/10ths of a mile South of Harris Road on Highway 53 a bipedal creature bolted in front of my cab less than 50 feet ahead of the cab's headlights.  The creature was at a dead run and didn't look towards the cab.  The creature was a crimson rusty brown in color with matted hair, very muscular, 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall and approximately 400lbs.  The arm facing the cab headlights hung knee length or longer, had human hands and black fingernails.  The creature took about 4 strides to cross the highway.  It seemed to have no neck just a head; sort of like a caveman.  Another vehicle was behind me and traveling very fast, but slowed way down when the creature appeared on the road.  That car was approximately 1/10th of a mile behind my cab.",
