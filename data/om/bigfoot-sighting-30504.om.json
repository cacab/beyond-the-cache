  "observed": "I work in the oil field ind. hauling salt water, and at one site, we have something big walking around. I have seen it for myself, as have a few others. But on the night of Aug. 26 2011, I seen its eyes on the other side of the fence that is at least 9-10 feet high. After I seen the eyes, it moved out of view, then started to throw rocks at the tank. The first thing that caught my attention was the lack of wild life sounds and the smell of a skunk, and the sound of something that sounded like a low growl. Another person had put a game camera up, and it got a picture of something blocking the camera 30 min before I had got there. I have seen other things in my time as a truck driver, but this is a little to close to home.",
