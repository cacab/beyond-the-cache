  "observed": "My story begins in the early part of June when I took a job at Josephine Creek Lodge.  My first sighting was on an after work excursion with my friend.  On June 16, 2001, we went bouldering at a place known as House Rock.  When we arrived, we noticed four prints, three entering and one exiting the sheltered area.  They were approximately 16 inches in length.  The ground was sandy and you could see digits. On June 23, 2001, my girlfriend came to visit this weekend.  On our day hike to Tri-Forest Peak the two of us found a print on the switchbacks, heading straight up.  Again, it was approximately 16 inches in length.  However, it seemed to be a bit wider than the previous prints found. One day after work, on July 27, 2001, I was heading down to my campground at Big Flat when I saw him.  He stood approximately 10 feet tall and appeared to have a fawn in his left arm that he carried like a football.  He saw my truck, looked over his right shoulder and ran up the hill like the six million dollar man. In the morning before work, August 9, 2001, I went fishing on the Salmon River.  I found footprints in a gravely riverbed, approximately 16 inches in length.  Moisture was found in the footprint heal and toe areas, and from the displacement of the footprint, it appears to be from the previous evening.  Again, digits were noticeable. I have photographic evidence of these prints.",
