  "title": "Bowhunter recalls dusk encounter on creek dike near Oak Grove",

  "timestamp": 687830400,
  "observed": "It was in October of 1991 or 1992. I was bowhunting in the evening. I was on a neighbors property along a creek. I was standing on the ground in front of a dike going around a field. the sun was just begining to set. I had taken a few steps to begin to leave when I heard rustling coming from behind me. I thought it might be a deer so I turned around and froze. I watched along the top of this dike or levee for the deer to come over the top. As the sound got closer I finally saw a head come over the ridge of the dike. As the form moved up the dike it got larger and taller, it moved over the dike no more than 50 yards from me. I could smell a musky slight skunky smell in the air. As this thing came down the same side of the dike I got down on the ground frozen with fear! I don't remember breathing but thought my heart was going to explode! At the bottom of the dike it stopped and looked around as if it knew something was in the area. As it began to walk away the pungent smell went away. When it was out of sight I got back up and ran home as fast as I could. When I got home I turned on ll the lights, changed clothes and left for town for the rest of the night.",
