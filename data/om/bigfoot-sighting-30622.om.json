  "observed": "On august 29th I was outside close to dusk with my litter of puppies going potty.  I heard the whistle I do to call the adult dogs a bob white whistle.  Thinking it was my parrot in the house I did a few back and forth  whistles. One of my adult dogs made a deep woof when we heard a loud rustle in the forest.  I looked up and saw a tall hairy creature staring at me.  It was very dark and let the branch go that it was holding down with its arm and stepped back into the trees.  I watched for a while and then my roommate came out the door and we heard a bunch of trees being moved.  I asked her if the parrot had been whistling with me and she said no he was quiet and eating.  We live on the edge of the hocking hills and hear knocking and banging alot but this is our only sighting.",
