  "observed": "I sumited a report to you of a sighting I had last September in Polk County, Oregon.  I was asked if I was interested in looking for tracks in that area.  At the time I said, \"No\". The area that I had my sighting seemed promising enough for me to check it out on the last two days of bow season last year.  I found an excellent hunting area for this year.  I had almost forgotten why I went up there in the first place and that was to satisfy my couriosity about possible bigfoot activity.  This morning 9/1/01 I was hunting in the area. I have been hunting in the area all week. I heard a strange noise and then a large tree fell in the forest. I will explain later.  I believe I have found indistinct tracks in several areas.  In these areas I saw and photographed trees that are snapped off in an unusual manner.",
