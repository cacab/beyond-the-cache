  "title": "Hunter in tree stand recalls startling early morning observation near Ft. Bragg",
  "date": "1995-10-14",

  "observed": "I was hunting the training areas in Ft. Bragg, NC. in 1995 and had planned to hunt a new area. I saw a valley on the map and plotted where I thought would be a good spot to set up a tree stand. I when in the woods about 0445 and got to the spot on the map and set up my equipment and climbed up about 24ft. All was quiet, and the sunrise began and the rays of the sun traveled across the forrest floor. I followed it with my eyes and as the sun reached in front of my tree stand a small, 3 ft., black, furry creature reared up from a sleeping position and ran away from the sun. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up!!! I don't know what it was. I have been hunting since I was 15 and have seen plenty of wild life in my time. I had a 30-06 semi-auto rifle and I was frozen stiff. Needless to say, I got the hell out of there and never went back. After all of these years, I now believe it was a \"child\" bigfoot.",
