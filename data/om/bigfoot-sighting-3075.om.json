  "observed": "While driving south on highway 199 from Grants Pass to Crescent City, my eight year old son said \"Hey Dad, what's that?\".  We were driving just above the Smith River as it snakes alongside the highway.  I assumed he was talking about perhaps a rafter or something but instead, to my surprise, he said \"I saw a hairy thing sitting on a rock in the middle of the river.  It was getting a drink or something\".  I asked him if he thought it was a bear.  He said \"No....it looked kinda like a gorilla\".  I have to go on what he said.  I didn't see a thing.  I was too busy driving.",
