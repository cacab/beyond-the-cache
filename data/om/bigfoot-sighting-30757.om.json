  "observed": "My girlfriend and i had been shopping at walmart in spruce pine nc late one night. we left to head for home which is about a 20 min drive. by this time it was about 2 am. we left wal mart and headed back out the highway toward the turn-off for marion(home). no cars were out only us, we see in our headlights about 150 feet ahead a dark brown hair covered animal crossing the road very slowly. We were probably traveling about 35mph. we looked at each other as if to see if the other was seeing the same thing i leaned forward in my seat to see if it was a bear, about that time we realized it was walking on two legs and was kinda side stepping and it was staring right at us. it was moving from the left side of the road to the right and then just disappeared into a field. we slowed down just as we approached the spot, it was and it was gone, no sign of it at all. this was something that neither of us had ever seen! I felt like whatever it was layed down in the field so we couldn't see it any more. we didnt say a word for a few minuets becuase we just couldnt believe what we had seen. then we were like... did you just see that ?? what was that?? later we realized we had definately seen a sasquatch!",
