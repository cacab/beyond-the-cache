Just finished eating .. it started to rain.. so I sat in my tent.. and all of a sudden I hear this scream..it kinda sounded like a woman screaming but extreamly loud.. followed by a couple of guttural grunts..it made my body tingle.. and I dont tend to scare easy..when I yelled into that direction HEY!! ... It sounded like a person jogging kinda skipping back into the thick woods..never heard anything like it before and have hunted there for 6 years ..it was so loud it kept echoing through the woods! Needless to say I slept in the truck that night .",
