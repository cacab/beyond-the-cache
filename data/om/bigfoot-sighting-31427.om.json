  "observed": "When I was 10 yrs old, going on 11, I had a sighting up above Lake Chelan, WA at Holden Village in the summer of 1978. It was after the 4th of July for sure, but I think it was August. My Parents cannot remember what month it was, but they think August as well. My family & I had been going to Holden Village every summer for several years. The only way to Holden Village is to take the Ferry from Lake Chelan 10 miles up the lake, get off the Ferry at Lucern & take a bus up a 17 mile logging road up the mountain to an old mining town. Holden village is a Lutheran retreat now but you can go up year round. I have not been back since I sighted what I think was a \"sasquatch.\" I have NEVER reported this to anyone besides my family & the Rangers/counselors who were there that night.... My family & I had met several other families that weekend trip and a few had kids my age. There was me, my friend (11), another two girls who were 12, & one 13 yr old boy. On the last night the kids were having a round of \"hide & go seek \" in the dark around the main camp. All the adults were gathered at the main picnic table area & all us kids were running around having a good ole' time in the dark. I was determined to not have any of the kids find me, so I decided to run off a bit further...over behind the maintenance shed, by the stinky garbage cans & over by a very steep drop off. My eyes were already adjusted to the dark, even though there were several outside lights in the main area. As I ran around the back of the maintenance shed, I stopped & heard a slight movement in the gravel on the hard ground....I stopped, looked over (10 feet away) & saw a HUGE black mass/shadow hunkered over the garbage cans, which were chained down. The huge mass stopped whatever it was doing, turned, & in one SMOOTH MOTION, turned at the waist ,& stood up right to about 8 plus feet tall. No smell, no noise,(except for the sound of crunching gravel on hard pan soil).  My first thought was, \"OMG! It's a bear!\"...but because of the motion & shape I thought...\"This is a MAN IN A COAT with his hood up\"....I was so shocked & confused that I backed up after about 3 seconds & then turned & ran to get my parents. Whatever it was could have reached out & grabbed me easily but did not. The only way it could have gone was after me (into a well lighted area), around the back of the building (another WELL lighted area), OR straight down a VERY steep shale cliff side down towards a river. When I found my folks & told them \"I saw a bear-man,\" they freaked out & got a camp ranger & reported that either a weirdo or a bear was behind one of the buildings ....I was told it was a BEAR, so ,of course, I believed it was the biggest bear in the whole world for years! There is more to the story, but I just wanted to let you guys know that maybe you might want to check out the Lake Chelan area! I have checked  to see if there have been any more reports...there have been a few. I know what I saw & my son has encouraged me to report this after all these years. I would be willing to take a lie detector test & my parents remember this whole thing as well. Many thanks, Really glad to get this off my chest! ",
