  "observed": "My uncle and I, who is only 2 years older than me, were playing on the hay bales that his neighbor always stored in the field between their houses in the sprign before gardening time.  Each house stands on a hill with a larger hill behind them.  The whole area was one huge field with a few trees here and there untill you got to the top of the big hill in back.  That is where the forest begins.  I was looking at the trees while my uncle was getting something when I noticed a large bipedal figure leaning against one of the trees.  My first impression was that it was a bear untill I noticed that the arm it was leaning against the tree with was straight out at a 90 degree angle to the body.  After a few more seconds of looking I realized it was roughly human shape but very large.  It was so far away I couldnt say how big exactly but having seen a truck on the hill before it had to be at least 7 feet tall.  I observed it for several minutes before my unlce returned.  I pointed it out to him and we watched it together for several more minutes.  We finally became too frightened to stay and run to the house to tell his dad.(my step grandfather)  He didnt believe us untill the family realised we were scared stiff.  He got a pair of binoculars and went out behind the house to look but the creature had left.  It occured to me later that the creature had been watching us play for an indeterminate time before I noticed it.",
