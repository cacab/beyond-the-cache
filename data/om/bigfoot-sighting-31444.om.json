  "observed": "I have been watching your show and this reminded me of something  I saw when I was around 10 years old.  I can remember almost every detail like it just happened. I am now 43 and do not live there anymore so I can't tell you the specific names of the roads but to this day I think I could take you there. I was fishing with my parents near Hudson, Michigan.  We were on a road that had a bridge on it that people fished at.  I think a way down is Lake Hudson Park.   There was woods down the way of the river. Toward the front of the wooded area was a really big raspberry patch. It was a bright clear day. It was hot and I was at the raspberry patch pulling the off the bush and popping them into my mouth.  I looked up and I saw a black outline staring back at me. I remember being absolutely paralyzed with fear.  The raspberry patch was very thick and dense and this creature was on the side of the patch towards the woods.  It wasn't a bear because it was more ape like and stocky. It was much to large to be a person and it carried itself more animal like than human.  I was close to it but because of the density of the patch and the thickness of the woods I didn't have a clear look at this creature. I remember just being so scared I was frozen, and then when I could finally break free I ran to my parents. They half listened to me but I called my mother today and she remembered me telling her about it. Later a wildlife officer came by and I asked him if there were any bear around the area and he laughed and told me no.  This happened 33 years ago, and the reason I am telling you this now is because after watching your show I remember connecting with something one of the people said and that was the fear that that runs through you when you see a squatch.  I don't know if I can provide you anything in terms of information but I just wanted to let you know.  Thanks.",
