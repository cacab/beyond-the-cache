  "observed": "Craig, Jeff and Dan were camping at lake Kachess. They were 16 - 17 years old at the time and it was their next to last school-based summer vacation. One day, lost to memory, they hiked about 2 miles above the lake, off the eastern side trail and, reaching a small meadow area with a 200 foot ledge overlooking the lake, they decided to roll large 2-man boulders over the ledge, into the lake. It made quite a racket going down the hill and when they hit the water it sounded like explosives going off. While doing this they noticed a dark upright animal with a reddish tint, standing at the meadow's forest edge, peeking out at them from behind a tree. It was between 50 and 70 yards away and slightly in shadow. It was covered in hair, kind of scruffy looking and once in awhile it would turn its body and there was a green tint to it. They continued throwing rocks off the ledge and watching this animal for about another half hour until it got too spooky and they decided to return to their camp site. They went back up the next day and stood in the spot the animal had been standing in. They estimated the animal as being 9 to 10 feet tall. They could only see, from the ledge the previous day, the animal from the waist up. They all had seen bear before and were quite familar with them. This was not a bear.",
