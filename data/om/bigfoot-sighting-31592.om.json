  "observed": "In 1989 in Osceola county was the firs time we saw it. This was in early November. My brother in law shot a deer while bow hunting. We waited until everyone was back in camp before our search for the deer. At that time I could carry a hand gun in the woods. We went out with a coleman lantern for the search.We went back to the tree stand and looked for blood. We followed the trail and it stopped. We looked all around and then we heard a noise that got our attention. I held the lantern high to see farther with no avail. Next we heard foot steps...pacing back and forth, heavy steps that had a lot of weight behind them..deliberate to get our attention..it did. We could barely make out the outline it appeared to stand 7 foot or so, could not make out features well. We believe that it took the deer and just wanted us to go away. Next it made this gutteral sound a warning so it seemed. I never heard anything like it in the woods before...hard to describe. We felt threatened and I took out my  hand gun and said if it came into the light I would use the pistol.Slowly we back tracked out from the area and back to camp. Next morning we looked for the deer and for any prints...nothing. In 2004 or 2005 the creature returned one evening way early in the moonlit morning (maybe2:00AM or 3:00 AM) and it was just outside of our cabin looking under a tarp that covered our firewood. The noise of the tarp woke us. The Squach was seen outside the window...it put the tarp down and turned and walked behind the pole barn and down the walking path and out of sight.",
