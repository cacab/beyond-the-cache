  "observed": "Myself And my friend were leaving a venue in the country. The location is mears, mi. We were driving down this curvy rd going roughly 30 mph. It was roughly midnight. I do know the exact location. My friend was driving and all of the sudden he says \" dude, what is that in the rd?\" we got roughly 20 ft from the object and my friend turned on his high beams. When he did this the thing stood up in the middle of the rd and then ran very quickly up a hill. There is no doubt that it was either a Sasquatch or someone in a very large big foot suit. It ran up the hill on two feet and it looked like a kind of \"skip\" like a ape. Could not be a bear. There were other people that weekend that claimed to see it also. I am very certain of what we saw. I have looked on the internet and there are quite a few sightings in this area.  The terrain is similar to the terrain that I have seen on your show.",
