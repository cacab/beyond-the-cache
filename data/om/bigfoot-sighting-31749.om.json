  "observed": "I'm (Name edited-out),  I had an encounter with what I know was a bigfoot.  I was camping in Packwood  WA and about 1:00 a.m.on July 3rd, 2011 I was building up my campfire when I heard the ungodly hollars, there were many and knocking of log against logs, and throwing stuff in the lake.  The lake was between my campsite and where bigfoot stood.  We know you had a research team outside of Packwood and I would like to meet with someone to discuss further.  I've been hunting in Packwood and in the Gifford Pinchot National Park for approximately 33 years and I know the entire area very well. I don't want to tell  you right now exactly where I was because it's my hunting area but I would like to talk to someone knowledgeable about Bigfoot. You can reach me at (xxx) xxx-xxxx any time.
