  "observed": "On my way from Louisa to Blaine, just before the Rich Creek boat ramp. I looked to my left to look at some horses that stay on this hill and I noticed two pine trees that I never seen before (which I thought to be pine trees). I told the person with me that I'd never seen pine trees in that spot before, she stated she had not either. No horses were around. But the next day we came by this same spot....NO PINE TREES...Whatever they were, one was standing, one was down on its knees, backs toward us, next to a big tree, color was a dark color from dark brown to a lighter brown to tips of blonde. The one standing was very large, tall and thick head came to a point. No neck that I could see. The one kneeling or on its knees, was the same almost in color, same shape in head, but didn't seem as wide at the shoulders.",
