  "observed": "This happened in the summer of 1972, either June or July and I would have been about seven years old. I was going fishing with my grandfather and cousin at Lake Tyler East. It was about an hour before dark and we were driving down CR 230 I believe. We had just driven through a section of land that had not been developed and when we came to a pasture I saw a large animal walking towards the tree line about 100 yards away. It was a dark grayish white color and was walking at an angle away from us. It turned to look at the car and seemed to have to turn its upper body to be able to see us, like its neck would not turn the way a human would. It sped up walking and I remember its arms really swung as it walked and it seemed like its legs never straightened out, not bow legged but with knee slightly bent.  Its hair was not really long, about an inch or so and the hair did not cover the face. The skin was very dark brown but not black and its palms were about the same color. The head seemed to sit almost on its shoulders and the head was slightly pointed, not extreme but enough to be able to see it. The body of the animal was big but not out of proportion to its height. When it got to the tree line it stepped over a 5 strand barbed wire fence almost in stride. This whole incident lasted about 20 to 30 seconds before we lost view of it. I remember telling my grandfather when I first saw it to look at that horse walking on its hind legs. He slowed to a near stop and watched the creature with me and my cousin. After it went into the woods my grandfather turned the car around and said we were going home. He also told us to never mention seeing this to anyone because people would say we were either crazy or a bunch of liars. My cousin who was six was really upset about it and so was my grandfather. As far as I know my grandfather never told anyone and my cousin won’t talk about it to this day. Thinking back the creature must have been about 7 ½ to 8 foot tall to step over the fence like that and probably would have weighed about 400 pounds. Most people tend to overestimate weight on animals.",
