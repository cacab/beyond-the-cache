  "observed": "It was during \"modern gun\" deer season, probably about 3 years ago. I really can't remember the exact year.  I was walking along a road that intersects two fields that were within the Piney Creek Wildlife Area.  These were basically clearcut fields, yet they always appeared to me to be well maintained.  I think this is probably because the land was very close to private property.  I was walking on this road when something in front of me just caught my eye.  There was a shape on the ground that appeared to be a footprint.  There was also another impression at the edge of one of the fields.  In other words, there was an inmpression leaving one field and then an impression (footprint?) in the middle of the road.  I don't know why it caught my attention like that, nothing like that really has before, nor has it since.  I decided to turn around and leave.  When i got home, however, I just couldn't get what I had seen out of my mind. The next morning my wife and i had to go up to Jasper, but on the way i told her that I wanted to stop and get some pictures of that impression.  It was only about two miles off of Highway 7 on one of the gravel roads which goes into the wildlife area.  In order to get to where i had seen this impression though, i had to leave my wife and little girl with the truck parked on the gravel road and then walk about three hundred yards down a narrow road.  This is a road that enters between the two fields, goes through them and then end at the end of the fields.  You can't get a two wheel drive truck down into them because 4 wheel drives had cut ruts down where the road enters the field.  Thus you can't turn the truck around hardly.  The impression was still there, so i laid my shotgun down beside it for scale, and took some photographs.  I also placed my size 10 boot beside the print.  It was little if any longer than my boot, however much wider than my bare foot would be.  The unique thing though, and this is what really got me, is that there were only three toes.  After I was finished, I headed back to the truck where my wife and little girl was. When i got to the truck, my wife said that, when she got out of the truck for a moment, she saw something further up the gravel road on the opposite side that I was on.  The growth was about waist high and she said it was crouched down in the growth looking at her.  When it saw her look, it stood up (whirling around at the same time) and disappeared back into the edge of the woods which bordered real close to the road.  I asked her what it looked like and she stated that it had the face of a human, yet also like that of a monkey.  She also said that it had hair on it's body.  I asked her how big it was and she stated that it really was not much bigger than a person.  It was just crouching there watching her.  The last thing she commented on was how fast it was.  She said that it was extremely fast. I have wondered what it was that she saw, and if perhaps it was connected to the impressions that I observed.  I also wondered if perhaps it was in the process of coming to the edge of that gravel road in order to cross it.  This would have brought it in the proximaty of the impression that i found.  When it saw my wife and truck sitting there it may have just crouched doen hoping not to be seen. I really don't know what i photographed or whether or not what i photographed is really a footprint.  My wife is pretty insistent however on what she saw. On a last note; before posting this, I did some checking on web sites and read various things that people say they observed or noticed.  I can't say that I smelled anything that day or even thought that something might be watching me.  I hunted Piney a long time before that incident and have done so often since then as well.  Except for that impression, I have never seen or noticed anything which was out of the ordinary.  I have heard rumors of sightings though.  Rumors which never really bothered me or that I even thought about.  They still don't bother me but i can't say that i don't wonder now.",
