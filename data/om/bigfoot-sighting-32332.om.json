  "observed": "For the last three months I have been hunting a 100 acre family plot of land that borders 8000 acres of WMA (wildlife management area) and I had several encounters with what I believe to be a foul smelling bigfoot. First incident and the closest was when I was in a climber hanging in a palm tree of a new area near a swamp and thick bottom; 30 min after being up in the tree I heard hard steps coming through the woods afterward I heard two loud claps as if something was hitting two trees together. I thought that maybe I may be freaking out over nothing then 4 minutes later I was greeted with the loudest deepest growl I ever heard in my life. Immediately my hair stood up on my head and I was denying that this was happening. After a few seconds of praying and reasoning that this is a figment of my imagination, this animal behind me took a few steps closer then repeated the growl. The second incident happened because I was scared to go into the woods so I took two friends with me on an afternoon hunt. The exact same thing happened that had occurred 3 weeks earlier. To conquer my fear I went back out after four weeks later. I was heavily armed. From a distance I heard a growl around the same time (first dark). Then an animal growled again and immediately I started shooting. I left the woods and the animal moved through the clearing at a pace I never seen. All I know was something was spreading apart the pines like a bulldozer. This incident prompted me to contact someone to investigate this situation. I have often been met by black bears in the woods but never have I experienced anything like this.  I believe we have the prime ground because this animal has become very territorial and refuses to leave.",
