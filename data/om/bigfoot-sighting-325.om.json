  "observed": "Dear Sirs: This early 1970s sighting was not of my own. I was a boy when my brother-inlaw of that day and one or two of his hunting friends had an excellant and fairly long term sighting, both via their eyes and through high powered rifle scopes. However I can relate some of this information to you and even put you in touch with two of the possible three people, can't guarantee they will talk with you about the sighting, but one never knows. In fact I spoke with my ex-brother in-law about this earlier this evening because I happened upon your website and explored it.  What is very significant is that Sam and Don had every opportunity to shoot this animal and/or person and thought about it, but could not because it looked to human! Only THREE DAYS later Big Foot reports hit the news. My father and Sam AKA Sandy, in front of me took a forest map out and Sam became quiet as the new sightings were only 15 miles from his encounter, and in the direction the creature was traveling. The newer sightings as I recall put the creature near Pear Blossum, CA on the other side of the mountains. I remember a news report of 1000 people lined up across the desert looking for anything and they did find some hair on a barbwire fence. To this day I know of no one having reported this first encounter three days prior. Another significant item is that in those days bear season and deer season overlaped or was one in the same. At first they thought this might be a deforemed bear (they had bear tags) as they witnessed this being walking on two legs just like any human and appeared to be 7 to 8 feet tall. They were a few hundred yards away on the other side of the caynon, (don't remember the name of the caynon) but their rifle scopes allowed them to see this clearly enough that viewing the face and shape they could not decide if this was an animal or a human. I remember Sandy/Sam saying it looked like a monkey man. The animal/person seemingly did not know they were there. They had bear tags and thought about shooting the creature but as I said could not make themselves do it. I recall Sam telling my father that it had to be a bear because it dropped to all fours when it climbed the steeper terrain. My father asked Sam: How did you guys climb it? The reply was the same as the deformed bear. About then my brother in-law was no longer jovial regarding the sighting and preffered not to discuss the incident. Until now I have more or less left the man alone about it. Today he is a Plant Manager for a large trailer company. Don still lives in Baldwin Park, CA but maybe moving to San Diego, CA. I seldom cross paths with Don nor have I never pursued the matter with him. If you folks are interested I can put you in touch with both of them but you may have to settle for what I have related. Without the permission of at lest one of the actual witnesses it might not be right to post this information. As for myself today I am 40 years old and drive for MTA and I am use to making out reports. I understand the need for accuracy without exaggeration. I hope this relayed information was not to long winded and useful. Tim P.  Tim P. only heard this story 2nd hand as a youth.",
