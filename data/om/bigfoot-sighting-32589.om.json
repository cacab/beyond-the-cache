  "observed": "Transcribed from a telephone message left on  BFRO.NET Hello, my name is xxxxx saw BF two years ago, my father encountered him about  10 years ago. I live in South Central Kentucky, we are about an hour from the Tennesse line and about 45 minutes east of I65 in Metcalfe County Kentucky.   Anyway  I’ve come face to face with him at 20 yards .  He turned left I saw the white around his face. He was 8 foot tall or better. I heard him make three steps  and I saw him walk up the street. I live about three miles out of town.   Anyway, I come in tonight and when I got out of my car I  heard  the awfullest scream I heard in my life.  Sounds a lot like what you guys sound like when you are on TV… And immediately, it there were  like about 15 dogs going crazy barking doing their worst after this thing squealed and squalled like it did.    Theres a family or two here, that’s lives in a real desolate area  seeing or encountering a bigfoot or sasquatch whatever you want to call it.  If you call me at  xxxxxxx      My name is xxxxxxxxx, I am 41 years old.",
