  "observed": "Over the past several months I have heard knocks in the woods behind my house. I live in the Berkshires in MA on a wooded 6 acre lot that borders a very mountainous area with over 100 undeveloped acres. In addition, I have had some rocks being thrown at night while I have been on my back porch. My most recent occurrence was a few week ago while standing on my back porch I heard some noises nearby in the woods.I scanned the area with my high intensity flashlight and saw some eye shine about 40 yards into the woods. I stared at it for a while and then the animal turned and moved deeper into the woods. I subsequently estimated that the eyes would have been on something at least 7-8 feet tall.   In addition, my wife and I have heard knocks in the past and they even responded to my knocks on one occasion last fall.",
