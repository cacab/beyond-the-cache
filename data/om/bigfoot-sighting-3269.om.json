  "observed": " In 1977 my husband and I bought a small hobby farm in Taylor County, Kentucky.....just outside the town of Campbellsville.   Our farm was surrounded by neighboring farms, but no one lived on the land bordering ours, the owners all lived in town.  So, our little farm was fairly isolated and I liked it that way.  In the summer of 1978, I believe the month was July, my husband while alone at home, heard a sound one evening, that frightened the daylights out of him.......and he doesn't frighten easily.    He called me at a friend's place, screaming at me, \"where are the shotgun shells ?\".    His attitude, his franticness, scared me.  I didn't know what was going on and he wouldn't tell me.....he just kept screaming \"where are the shotgun shells ?\".    I finally told him and he slammed the phone down.     It wasn't until later, that my husband related the story of what he had heard.      He never did see anything and years went by with no answers to that 'cry' he had heard that evening.  (Although, for the first several years, as we watched 'nature' films, which had various wildlife 'cries', I kept asking him.......did it sound like that ?   To which he always replied \"No, it was like nothing I had ever heard before\".)  Now, it's 1988, again in the summer, and the month is August.  It had just started to turn dark in the evening, when my husband came in from outside and all he said was \"Do you want to hear that sound ?\"    He didn't have to say anymore.  I knew right away what he was referring to, so we both went back outside and stood outside our kitchen window.   I was standing there listening when I told him \"I don't hear anything\".  He quickly replied......\"Shhh.....just wait\".    So I continued to listen.   All of a sudden this horrible 'cry' came up from our woods, where our two creeks merged.  It caused chills to run up and down my spine!  My first reaction was shock.  Then another 'cry' was heard.   This time, I felt myself slowly edging backwards towards the house.  Whatever this 'thing' was.....the 'cry' was like nothing I had heard from any wild animal before and I remember starting to shake with fear.    Then another 'cry' was heard, this time it came from across the road in the woods, where the creek continued to flow.   This cry hadn't even \"cresendoed\", when there was another cry, heard from our side of the woods again.   Oh my God.......there were \"two\" of them I thought!!   That was it, I turned and ran into the house.   My husband came in with me, but he grabbed the shotgun and went back outside.   He wanted me to hold the light for him, as he investigated the woods.....and I stated \"You're out of your mind, I'm not going back out there!\"  That basically was all that happened that night.  My husband never saw anything, nor did I.   But I did smell something.....it was a very strong musty odor, that wasn't pleasant.   Actually, the odor was like wafting across with the gentle breeze.....so sometimes it was very light, and sometimes much stronger.  I remember wrinkling up my nose, when it was strong, and thinking \"what on earth is that smell ?\"  So now, after 10 years, I had heard the same sound that my husband had heard alone back in 1978.  The next day, I did go down to where the two creeks meet and walked along the banks, looking for strange prints, but didn't see any.   Even though it was broad daylight, and a gorgeous sunny day......just being down there gave me the creeps.   What had happened the night before, had really shook me up and never again did I enjoy being down there anymore.    Just the replay in my mind of those 'cries', was enough to make me 'jumpy' whenever I was close to the woods/creeks area again.  The sound of those 'cries' stuck in my mind....and I had a knawing feeling, that I had heard that sound before......but 'where' ???    I was a video collector back then (still am) and quickly went through all of my video collection, to see if anything would jog my memory.    I have many natural wildlife tapes, so I thought, maybe that is where I had heard it.  But when I came across a movie entitled \"Sasquatch\", a feeling inside of me, told me to watch this tape.......so I did.   I sat in my living room and watched all the way through that movie, until close to the end....they had the sound......the very same sound......that my husband and I had just heard a few nights ago!!     As soon as I heard it, chills again ran up and down my spine.   I quickly rewound the tape, to the beginning of where that \"sound\" was and left it there until my husband came home from work that evening.    As soon as he came home, I told him I had something I wanted him to watch.   So within a few minutes, he was seated in the living room and I played the tape.   As soon as that 'cry' was heard on the tape, he jumped up yelling \"That's it!.......That's the sound!!\"     We replayed that part of the tape over and over again.....trying to allow all this information to sink in.   We now felt, we *knew* what we had heard......it was a \"Sasquatch\".  Or actually, two of them........in the middle of Kentucky!  An 'experience' like this, you don't ever forget.....you can't!    It'll stay with us, for the rest of our lives!",
