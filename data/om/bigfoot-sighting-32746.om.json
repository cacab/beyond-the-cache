  "observed": "After watching several episodes of your show on Animal Planet, I decided to tell my story; I am actually getting goose bumps thinking of it. This happened in Orlando, Florida around the early 2000’s,  we lived in a suburban area but around it has a heavy forest area and this was before any of the major shopping centers and housing were built. My cousin had come up for the weekend from Miami to hang out, we were probably in our second year of high school. I remember it was around 2am to 4am and we were driving home and before our entrance to our neighborhood there is a small lake with a patch of forest in the middle of it, and across from it there is the neighborhood playground and a daycare which was pretty dark at that time so my cousin decides to pull in by the playground to smoke a cigarette. So the lake was across from us and the car’s front was facing the playground, I stayed in the car and my cousin was leaning on his side of the car. After a bit my cousin starts frantically trying to open his door which I don’t know if it got locked and he left the keys in the ignition or the door doesn’t open from his side, so I look in the rear view mirror and there standing is this huge dark figure ( here comes the goose bumps again) standing there, in the dim light you can see the fur texture and the muscles, so I turn around and look through the window and I see it just standing there like if it was shocked to see us there and I remember as soon as I opened the door and my cousin  started the car it took off to the right and we hauled butt to the left towards our neighborhood.  When we got to the entrance of our neighborhood we decided to go back towards where it was heading and of course we couldn’t find no trace. I can still picture the figure plainly and right now I feel the tingling of goose bumps as I am thinking of it. We didn’t tell anybody about the incident and being that young we wouldn’t think people will believe us anyway, its just crazy our something like that can stay planted in your mind after so long so clearly, but I just wanted to let you guys know my story, keep up the awesome work with the show and the research.",
