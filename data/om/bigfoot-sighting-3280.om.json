  "observed": "I saw what I think was a bigfoot in the late summer of 1977 in Cameron County, PA. My dad , grandfather and members of the camp we belonged to were up there to cut firewood for hunting season. One night late my grandfather, a friend and me were the only ones still up.  We saw a tall creature come on the porch and try to kick the front door down.  It then ran off the porch and around the back of the camp . It let out the loudest yell/scream  -  it woke up almost everyone in the camp.  It was clearly walking on hind legs and had hands not paws and was a gray/light brown in color. I saw it again when we were leaving on Monday it followed the truck we were riding in for a few miles up the road. This camp is 14 miles up a dirt road. It is very remote.  I never saw it again but was always afraid to go around there by myself.  We also found several squirrels with their skin peeled up to their head eaten by front porch.  This was usually when we arrived not while there.",
