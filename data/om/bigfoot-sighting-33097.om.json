  "observed": "My brothers and I were swimming in the creek across from my Mom and Dad's house when I was 11 or 12 years old. I am 40 now and I can still see it very vividly in my mind's eye. I had left my watch at the \"Deep Part\", which is what we call the part of the creek we swam in. I had tried to get one of my brothers to go back with me and get my watch. Neither of them would go with me. I tried for about anther half hour or so to get them to go with me to get my watch none of them would go. So it was about 4:30 to 5:00 in the afternoon when I finally got the nerve to go get my watch. The bottom that lead down to the \"Deep Part\" is approxiamtely 100 to 125 yards long to the fenceline to the waterjole where we were swimming. I got to in front of the neighbor's which a little more than half to where the \"deep Part\" is at the fenceline. When I got to just infront of or just a little past their house, I saw a tall black figure, walking upright, walk along that fenceline. I saw it take 3 steps then my hair stood on end and I ran back to our house. I told my family and they said that I saw a deer. I am telling you guys this was no deer I saw it take 3 step, it was tall and it was dark colored. If I had to guess it was 7.5 to 8 feet tall and its stride was 6 to 7 feet long. Its elbow was right to the top of its hips but the hand didn't quite reach the knee.",
