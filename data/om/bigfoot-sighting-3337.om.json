  "observed": "While driving down the road about 10:30 pm I saw something standing on the left side of the road where the road curves to the right.  I threw my headlights on bright and turned the wheel to the left and drove streight to it. I was sideways in  the road. As I neared it I stopped and I had a clear view of it.  It was so tall that I had to lean closer to the steering wheel to look up into its face.  I could see him (clearly a male) from just above his knees to the top of his head.  I looked streight into his eyes.  He seemed to be comunicating with me though his eyes.  He let me get a good look at him and then he gave a nod and I knew I was to go. He was at least 7ft tall or more with silver and black hair some of it at least 4 to 5 inches long and dark outdoors type skin (where it was exposed. His eyes resembled that of a dogs and were the color of a alaskain husky and wide flat nose and a wide thin mouth like a mans. He never opend his mouth. Just stood there and looked at me and blinked some and make jesters with his head and eyes. When he knodded at me I knew it was time to leave so I turned the steering wheel very slowly ( I felt dazed) and drove on down the road.  I estimated the time I set there about 15 to 20 mnutes.  I went home about 1/4 miles up the road.Then I trembled  was so excited I could hardly walk.  I never was afraid.",
