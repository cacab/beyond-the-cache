  "observed": "I like to go to Gotch Park and watch the Eagles. I used to stand in the middle of the bridge for a cigarette before I went home from work. I had done this a few days in a row. That day I got out of my truck and felt like I shouldn't be there. As I walked to the middle of the bridge I felt VERY Uneasy. I lit my cigarette and starred out over the river. I felt like I was being watched and I started to get scared. It was coming from the other side of the bridge on the right hand side. Whatever it was I knew that it was not human nor an animal and it was a big male. I felt like he was curious as to why I went there every day to the same spot and just wanted to watch what I was up to. I looked around and could not see anything. I built up my courage, looked down and started walking slowly to the other side of the bridge. As I started walking I heard a big Crash into the river and saw a huge log floating down, then I heard a low huff. Like someone let out their air threw their nose in frustration with a little noise from the throat. The log had dried vegetation on it so I knew it was laying on the forest floor. I don't know how many pounds it was but it was huge. The biggest guy I know wouldn't have been able to throw this thing in the river with little to no effort. I looked to where it came from and saw nothing. I slowly turned around and walked slowly to my truck. I wanted to run, but I didn't want it to run after me if I ran. I got into my truck and took off. I was scared and shaken. I haven't been out on the bridge by myself ever since.",
