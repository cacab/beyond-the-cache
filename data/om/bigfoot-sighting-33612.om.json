  "observed": "Bigfoot have been living, and sleeping on my property here in FL  (known of since 1969). They do whistle signals, I used to hear them quite frequently. The last two sightings, within the past year(eyes on), were by one of my grown sons \"that thought the old timers here were telling \"Booger-y stories\", until he saw him. My neighbor and I went in search of \"someone messing around in the wooded area\". Long story short he ran towards the heavy footsteps (heard clearly on the leaves and brush), thinking he was going to see a man. I stayed directly across from him (about 30 yards), as he ran at what he was sure would be a man.  He found out differently as it ran with lightening speed. As it passed me, it looked like an 8 or nine foot tall flash as it ran past me in the moonlight. I always feel safe at night, because bigfoot beds close to the house near my bedroom window.  It looks like a deer bed, but 8-10 feet long. I haven't seen him laying there, but I have been in the woods long enough to know what a \"bedding area looks like\"! He eats grapefruit off of the tree, sometimes leaving a large bite mark on a half of grapefruit (usually hanging three feet above my reach).",

  "location_details": "Please do not post it online. I live in a wooded area, that used to be only 10 acres inhabited out of the surrounding 500 acres. There have been a male & female spotted on my dirt lane (that was about 30 years ago, when an Uncle saw them). I still believe there are more than one, because I hear the whistle signals. People I've told , commented \"oh, they whistle too (said sarcastically-doubting Thomases)\". I did not know that the whistles were signals until I watched your show tonight. Makes me feel alot better knowing that somebody besides me knows that they whistle. When my garden (200x100 feet) was still growing, lots of vegetables were missing. Now, if I leave vegetable and fruit scraps out, up high, it will eat them.",
