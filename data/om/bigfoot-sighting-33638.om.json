  "observed": "I'm 51 yrs old.  My sighting happened twenty odd years ago but I need to tell someone about it.  I've finally come to grips with it and now it's time just to tell someone...who won't think I'm a nut-case. Here goes.  At one time, I lived in a house surrounding a small pond in the woods in Columbia.  I fished all the time. The pond was down a small hill right in my back yard. I thought I was in heaven.  I usually fished at night when my kids (at that time) were asleep.  I used lighted bobbers.  Often I felt I was not alone but thought it was my imagination. One evening, I thought I heard a huff-growl and glanced around behind me. There it was.  Just standing there looking at me.  I squinted my eyes and rubbed them in case my eyes weren't seeing correctly.  I still saw it.  I didn't feel panicked til it moved.  The thought that it wasn't a human scared me so much I dropped my pole, and high-tailed it all the way up the hill til I was safe in the house. I never went fishing at night or alone again.  Thank you for reading this.  I feel better getting it out.",
