  "observed": "I was taking a walk up the path I had been excavating through my woods. I had been doing this by hand the previous day. I wanted to make a loop path through the thick vine maple and hazelnut brush on my property, when I suddenly got spooked for no discernable reason. I stopped and looked around, when I was growled at by something that sounded like a dog back in the woods. I had my gun, and thinking it was a coyote, I advanced and heard it running through the woods. Later, I looked around by the front of my woods behind my burnpile, and found odd looking feces. Full of a light colored hair. The next day, I went into my woods again early in the morning, and in the same spot, I heard a loud knocking like someone with at least a six inch rock banging it on a tree just out of sight. Within fifty feet of me. Once again, I looked for it, but found no sign, but for no real reason, I was scared even with a .45 cal handgun in my hand. Decided to report this after reading other accounts from pierce county similar to mine.",
