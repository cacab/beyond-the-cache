  "observed": "I literally live 200 yards from the Hwy 71/Camp Clark exit in Nevada, MO., its the very edge of town. My daughter and her children were gone that night and I was watching out the front door for the Church van to bring the kids home. There are only two street lights on this road and is mainly open fields around the 9 homes on in. There is a Wal-mart Super Center two blocks away and a new Pilot truck stop about three. The one big field across from the Pilot is where I saw this thing! It looked like it was cutting across the empty field and headed southward out of town. It was at least 8-9 foot tall (by measure of the trees in the field and quite large. The creature roared just like a cross between a lion and a wolf-both of which I have heard. It crossed behind the house across the street and started banging trash bins and continued on into the countryside.",
