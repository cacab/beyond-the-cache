  "observed": "It was opening morning of firearm deer season, November 15. Approximately 8:30 a.m. It was unusually warm for this time of year. I was sitting in my deer stand roughly a mile to a mile and a half away from my dad who was also in his deer stand. It was really quiet and still that morning. There was a really musty-damp smell that rose in the air. Shortly after that there was a scream that resembled a womans scream, but not quite. That happened twice within a few minutes. Made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Shortly after that the musty smell had left. Never seeing anything out of the ordinary, I stayed in my stand and finished out the morning hunt. Upon picking my dad up for lunch that day, he had asked me if I had heard the screams also. He described them to me the same way. NO other sounds were heard that day. The very next morning, my brother about 3 miles away said he had hear the same noise. Never did find out what it was exactly. It was however, like nothing I've ever heard before.",
