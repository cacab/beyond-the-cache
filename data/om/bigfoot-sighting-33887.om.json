  "observed": "This was at Davison US Army Airfield, Ft Belvoir Virginia. This was a while back so please hang in there with me. From late 1977 to Dec 1979 I was assigned to Davison as a Military Policeman. The airfield is not that large and I am pretty sure it's still an active military installation even now. The airfield is pretty much surrounded by a wooded area and part of the airfield is on a small swamp. When I started working there I was chided by other MP's to be careful of the so called \"DUSAA Swamp Monster\" it was called. We had to have a walking 2 man patrol a couple times a night walk the perimeter fence inside the field area. There were countless times while on those walking patrols that I occasionally made, where sounds were heard not only from the swamp area but also the wooded area along the south perimeter fence. By sounds I mean you could hear branches breaking, not small branches mind you, but I mean a VERY LOUD audible CRACK, you'd hear dogs barking in the distance and occasionally some kind of animal - which after hearing recordings on the net of a Squatch - they sounded AWFUL familiar! Randomly I also had to pull guard at the main gate which is right there on Route 1 - the main entrance to the airfield. I've had the crap scared out of me more than I like to think about at that gate at night - you're there all by yourself in a small wooden gate shack with 1 street light right above you and that's it. Anyway, to the south in the woods I've heard bangs (what you all call knocks) and animal noises, I've seen deer running like all hell and jump the fence on to the air field in the middle of the night getting away from something and only 1 time, and it was 1 time way too many, when I saw a deer following the fence at about 2 AM one night and I heard something in the woods, I yelled out and I saw the red reflection of 2 eyes staring at me back from the blackness just inside the trees just out of range of the street light - I still see those eyes when I think about it and it's been what... 34 years!!! One night, about 10pm, or there about, I had a civilian motorist come to the gate off highway 1 and ask me to call the State Police, I asked why and he said this big BIG hairy thing... yup he said thing ... walked across the road in front of him and headed onto Ft Belvoir property and he almost hit it. He thought at first it was a man in a gorilla suit but it was way too tall to be a man. This guy was shaking like hell too. I told him that it's probably gone by now and the [troopers] probably would not find it. I had heard of other reports by motorists and even the State Police about sightings along Route 1 between DUSAA and Ft Belvoir.  This happened year round, almost any month of the year.",
