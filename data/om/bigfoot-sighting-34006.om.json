  "observed": "April 2,2008 I was attempting to get back to my home in the woods; we had had a very heavy wet snowfall -- blizzard like conditions== the night before which prevented me from driving home that night.  The following morning was very sunny and just above freezing.  As I attempted to drive down my two-track road my 4WD SUV became stuck in the wet, deep snow. The snow came nearly to my knees making walking difficult.  As I turned up my road I noticed foot prints leading down my road, at which time I attempted to follow in the tracks.  Needless to say I was amazed at how large these prints were and the distance between each print. . . the prints were approximately 15 inches long and 8 inches wide with a stride of approximately 4 feet.  These prints were prestine in nature and straight covering 100-150 feet. Being a very skeptical person about \"Big Foot\", I have absolutely no idea what else to think. I now am rethinking my original doubt.",
