  "observed": "I was returning home from a NFL football game that I had attended out of state.  It was about 8:45pm. The road I was traveling on had a lot bends with patches of woods on both sides, broken up by houses every so often.  It is a back road that connects two towns.  The posted speed limit ranges from 10mph to 45mph.  I was traveling at about 55-60mph on the straighter sections(I was trying to get home, I had been driving for a couple of hours).  This is where it happened.  One of my good friends was sitting in the front with me.  We had the radio up loud and was singing and staring straight ahead. Two more of my friends where in the back seat talking.  As I came around a bend into a straight-a-way, with woods on both sides, something caught my vision just in the edge of the headlights(high beams).  I saw the mid and lower torso, and legs of what appeared to be a person.  It appeared to be crossing the road. I saw it take a right and then left stride and then it went into the trees on the right side of the road.  I vaguely saw the color, it was a light brown.  When I first saw the movement I thought it was a person going into the woods, this is the movement it had, however it glided with great speed.  It happened so quickly, I thought that I had imagined it until I looked at my friend sitting next to me, he was staring back at me, this made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.  I asked him if he \"seen that\" and he yelled \"yeah\".  I had slowed down to about 40mph with the intent to stop(not really knowing what to do) when the two in the back seat yelled \"whats going on?\"  I said, me and (name of friend) saw something, and the two in the back told me to keep going, they did not want to stop.  I now wish I had. stopped.",
