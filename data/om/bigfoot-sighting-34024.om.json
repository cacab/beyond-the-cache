  "observed": "I was out looking for old abandoned gold mines outside of Georgetown Lake in Montana to do some prospecting in the summer of 2010. Around 4 pm as I was traveling back down logging road 242 north of Georgetown Lake in my FJ Cruiser. A rock came flying through the trees from my right and hit my cruiser's roof top leaving a sizable dent in the roof. I saw the rock as it bounced off the roof and fly down the hillside. I immediately stopped thinking some kid or person threw a rock at my truck. As I jumped out of my truck to see who or what threw the rock from up the hillside a large dark creature disappeared up the hill and into the trees. I thought to myself \"No way, It couldn't be\". But I have the dented roof  to prove that what I believe to be a Bigfoot threw the rock.",
