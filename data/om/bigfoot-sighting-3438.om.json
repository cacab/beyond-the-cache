  "observed": "Just after dinner DK was sitting around the campfire looking at a ridgeline he had earlier observed a cow elk go over. He now saw what appeared to be a large, black, hairy upright ape... \"like the one in the movie taken in California, but not as filled out.\" He called to the other family members to come and see this animal and the creature turned around, looked at them with a \"disgusted\" ape face, took very long strides up the hill to the ridge and with it's left hand, grabbed a 20 foot Fir tree and shook it violently a couple of times, then went down the other side of the ridge. It looked like it had very long arms; almost reaching it's knees. They were amazed that it could take such long strides up that hill, without the aide of pulling on trees. The son-in-law and grandson (who is 6' 4\" tall) went up to the area where they saw this animal, to look for it or it's tracks. They came up to the tree they had seen it shake and determined the animal was bigger than the grandson. They didn't find any tracks. The animal was about 120 yards away and the face could be seen quite clearly. The eyes were very dark but no white was seen, possibly large hairy eyebrows and the face looked like an apes and it had hair on it as well. The head looked like it had a small cone shape to it. When it turned to look at them it turned it's whole body, not just its head. The sighting lasted between 30 and 40 seconds.",
