  "observed": "It was in 1971.  Maybe 1972...roughly there about.  I had just finished eating breakfast.  My mother asked me to go and empty the leftovers for our dogs.  I went to the side porch, which was about 4 feet off the ground, and saw a tuft of off-white fur sticking out from under the porch.  Thinking it was our dog, Whitey, I tried to dump the breakfast scraps on him.  I missed by a couple of feet.  I then turned around to go back in when I heard a scuffling sound.  Thinking it was our dog eating the scraps, I turned back around to see.  But instead I saw a creature that was taller than me, and I was standing on the porch.  It had to be at least 7 feet tall, covered in an off-white fur - except for an oval around the face.  Unfortunately, I don't remember what its face looked like.  Its arms hung almost down to its knees.  I dropped the frying pan, and tried to scream.  Nothing came out.  The animal turned back to look at me as it was loping in slow motion around the side of the house.",

Turn onto the first road on the left (not sure of the name of this road...maybe Flat Rock Church Road).  Go to the end of this road, passing Flat Rock Baptist Church on the left.  At the end of this road, take a right.  I think that this road is called Hamptonville Road.  Go about 2 to 3 tenths of a mile.  On the right, there is a very small wooden house sitting down in the middle of what looks like a field.  This is where the sighting occurred.",
