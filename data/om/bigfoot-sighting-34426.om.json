  "observed": "I was out hiking one morning on a popular local trail when I decided to explore the area around it using my GPS. It is an open hammock containing old growth liveoaks with a lot of surrounding history from the sugarmill period all the way back to the first native americans that inhabited the area thousands of years ago. I was \"off trail\" approximately several hundred yards when I came upon an un-natural looking intertwined tree formation capped off with a dead \"y\" shaped branch weaved in the top. I tried to think of how this could have occurred naturally but it simply could not have. I marked the site and took pictures and basically forgot about it until I read a report of an encounter in the same area by some local fishermen. I now wonder if it is a navigation or territory marker of some kind.",
