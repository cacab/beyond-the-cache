  "observed": "I was fishing March 31,2012 on the flathead river in montana about 6 miles west of Perma heading towards Paradise. I had to use the bathroom and was headed to the outhouse at the fishing site. when I seen a very strange foot print. So I took a picture of it, it was made by something with a very large barefoot. No shoe made this print, the only thing is the print was there for a bit how long don't know. It was cold and breezy so for someone to be walking around with no shoes I doubt it. I am going back April 3rd, 2012 and will see if we can get a cast made of the print if it is still there with a better object showing proper size. the prints went from the rivers edge to back up the bank headed to the mountain behind. One good print and partial of another.",
