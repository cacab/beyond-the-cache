  "observed": "My friend said he was fishing at the Vermilion River which is in central Illinois & flows into the Illinois river. Anyway he was leaving after dark in his truck and his dog was running ahead of him on the dirt road about 50-100 yrds out when he turned the bend looking for his dog he seen it and said it was huge at that point his dog b-lined it strait to the truck and jumped in. I asked him if it was a bear even though there are no bears around  here, I also asked if he got out to see what it was and he said he was scared so bad that they turned the truck the opposite direction & got out asap, this river valley is very remote with trees & of course no lights down there.  The fact that he did not get out to see what it was surprised me because my friend is one big dude prob 6.7 250-300lbs. I told him the ironic thing about this was that everyone else that has spotted bigfoot at the river prob just saw him! he did not think that was very funny. Anyway I'm not making this up , we have both hunt and fish , he was not looking for attention by telling me this.",
