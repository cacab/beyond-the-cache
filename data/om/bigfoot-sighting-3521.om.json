  "observed": "It was a year ago, during deer hunting seaseon (2000)   It was at dusk. When i was going around the outside of the timber I had to go around a point. When I started to go down the other side there it was shaking a tree. It did that for a little bit I stopped to look at it, said some thing to it, then I whent  75 yards further to some open field, saw some deer,  shot at the deer.  I heard it take off running through the timber. It looked about 8 feet tall, black, hairy. I could not see much of anything else. the time that I stopped and looked at it, it acted like a curious child like it used the tree to play peekaboo. That's what it seemed like. I have not seen it yet this year but the weather has not changed yet. It usually comes around in the fall. I'll keep an eye out for him when I hunt.",
