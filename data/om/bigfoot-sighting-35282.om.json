  "observed": "I never believed in these sort of things until 4 years ago. I live just outside of a small Michigan village of Marion MI, me and my sister were at the bus stop. I'm now 22 and still afraid to be outside alone without a gun. We always heard animals like deer and wolves or even bears but what happened this certain day scared me for life. Me and my sister were down at the bus stop, no one ever travels our road. We were getting bored not knowing school was canceled, sun still not up, we smelled something foul. I figured it to be a bear since they were common. About 10 minutes later we heard cracking branches and I assured my sister. About five minutes later a large figure knocked a small dead tree over and chased me and my sister.  I made it in the door of my house and watched it keep running straight in to the trees. Got my sister inside and my mom had to be late for work every day after that. I still remember the grunts and growls and still wake me in nightmares at night. People have always called me crazy for it but I know what I saw. We contacted the police who evaluated the area and took samples off the ground. I have not thought much about it til last night when I heard it again.",
