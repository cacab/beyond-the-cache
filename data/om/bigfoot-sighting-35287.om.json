  "observed": "On 5/05/2012, myself a friend and my 2 sons were fishing at the spillway in Kanopolis Lake around midnight.  We were on the north side of the spillway and we were the only ones there.  I happened to turn around and see something move up on the hill north of us.  I told Stacey the friend of mine and she looked and seen some red eyes looking at us. Whatever it was it was very large and kept peeking around a large tree at us.  This went on for a good 45 minutes or so.  Stacey also heard a knock and a scream coming from that direction, I could not hear it due to the water running closer to me.",
