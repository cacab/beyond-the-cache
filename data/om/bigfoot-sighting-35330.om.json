  "observed": "I have a few, where I live in Charlotte county, borders the web reserve, and is woods for miles and miles, when I started to build my home, just after hurricane Charlie, I had an rv trailer on my property to live in while my home was being built, so I could keep an eye on the building supplies, I had a hot tub outside of my trailer and I would take a soak in it every other night or so usually after midnight, many times I would hear what would sound like someone smacking 2 2x4s together some distance away, and sometimes it would come from different directions, I would sit there thinking to myself why in the world is someone working out here in the woods at 1am, but I just blew it off, after the home was built I didn't hear the wood smacking anymore, because I was in my home and not outside late at night, then I had a deck built on the front of my home, my home is a 2 story home and the deck is on the second floor in the front, after the deck was built we started using it at night and would you believe it I started hearing the sticks hitting again every once in a while not every night, still I was thinking to my self why is someone working so late at night, then I was watching a bigfoot show and saw that they bang sticks together to talk to each other and then it all made sense to me, about 5 months ago one of my lids to one of my fish boxes were lifted off and about 20lbs of mullet were taken out of my boat in my yard, I went out to my boat around 3am to get ready to go fishing and during my walkaround of the boat to check the lights and tires I noticed my ice box lid not on, the lid weighs around 40 to 45lbs and has a bungee cord on it, the bungee cord was still attached but the lid was pulled to the side and fish were taken, and I had a weird feeling that something was looking at me so i fixed the lid and jumped into my truck and drove off, also about 3 or 4 months ago I took my son on a cubscout camp out and we had a small group of around 12 to 15 children, usually there are over 1000 people at a camp out but this time it was just our pack on a special camp, I woke around 230am to use the bathroom and then laid down to go to sleep then I heard a yell that lasted for about 10 seconds and it sounded like one of the yells that I have heard returned on one of the shows on tv, I was born and raised in the woods in fla and am a commercial fisherman and know all the sounds that you will hear in the woods and near shore, and in fla we have a bunch, some from normal animals like foxes or bobcat or panthers will make you get chicken skin and your hair stand on end, but the yell I heard that night was like nothing I've ever heard, it didnt scare me but I knew what it was.",
