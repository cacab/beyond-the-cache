  "observed": "NOTICE: We are unsure of what we've seen! I live on a golf course in NE GA. I have lived in the area my entire life (23 years). Every sunday and wednesday, me and my buddy Brandon play 18 holes. It was sprinkling rain so we were trying to finsih up the round quickly. As we pulled up to the green on #17 we witnessed what appeared to be about a 6ft animal jump out of a tree, easily 25ft in the air. It hit the ground with a tremendous thud and faster than I could imagine running it jetted deep into the tree line. We initially thought it was a moutntain lion because of the color. It was light brown, almost a sandy color. However, I believe it was simply too large to be a cat of any type. We then immediately thought perhaps a black bear was molting and was in its \"cinnamon\" color phase, but i dont think its possible for a bear to move this quickly. Whatever it was, the hair on my neck still stands when I think about the tree shaking after it leapt to the ground. Pretty awesome experience!",
