  "observed": "In southern Indiana, Unionville October 1990 or 89.  My sister and I were on our way home late at night (approx. 2:00 a.m.) when a bigfoot walked in front of my sister's Honda touching the front of the vehicle. It was very hairy and had long arms. It walked upright, but this creature had a sideways gait as though limping or injured. It looked straight at us and walked slowly. It did not appear to be afraid. It was approximately 5 foot four I'd say. It closely resembled an orangutan.",
