  "observed": "I live in a fairly remote part of Adams county, Pennsylvania and the event in question occurred near my house in the Michaux state forest near Tick Tock and Pine Ridge Lane. The forest here is mainly white pines and oak. It is at a high elevation and there is enormous amounts of mountain laurel and high rododendron. On this morning i awoke for a morning bowhunt. When i left my house to walk the half mile or so to an area I had seem some deer sign previously, I noticed that the weather was going to be perfect. there wasnt any wind at all and it was cool so the ground was crunchy. While walking to my stand in the dark i got maybe two hundred yards from my stand and I heard this noise that scared the hell out of me. it was sort of like a howl. i had never heard anything like it before in my life. i tried to ratianalize it as a wild dog or coyote and continued on. A short while later i was twenty five feet up in my stand watching the woods around me as lightness came. shortly after daybreak, i heard several deer crashing through the laurel towards me. I readied my bow and four does came running within fifteen yards.  they appeared to be spooked by something. A couple minutes (or so it seemed) later i heard more crunching coming towards me. i again got myself ready in case a buck was following.  the noise that was approaching was kind of strange. it sounded more deliberate as it closed in. I saw several flashes of brown hair through the thick laurel and then i saw it. it was no deer, it was a bipedal creature about 7-8 feet tall. as it ran by me (it never stopped) i noticed it had matted hair all over it. By this point i had nearly .... a brick, then i heard more sounds coming toward me. two more bigfoots were approaching very fast. These ones stopped and i got a fairly good look at them. one appeared to be substantially smaller than the first one and it was dragging a baby bigfoot along with it. these also fled the area very quickly and it seemed as though they were following the largest one. After all sasquatchian activity ceased, i sat in my seat and checked my pants. i was scared to death. i also noticed the bigfoots left a foul, garbage like odor behind. Finally i gathered myself enough to get down the tree and back home. i have not returned to this spot since i had that multiple bigfoot encounter. Since that event i have seen other evidence of sasquatchian activity here. i think this area is full of bigfoots.",
