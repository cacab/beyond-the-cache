  "observed": "About a month ago around 9:30pm cst, I was going out to feed my dogs after working outside with the kids all day, when I heard 3 SOLID wood knocks. The series was immediately followed by a horrific cry like I've never heard before (or since until I watched the show you did in Indiana) - the series of Knocks done in Morgan forest sounded more hollow than the knocks I heard at my house - the call or scream was dead on - except the one I heard lasted longer). After dropping the bag and running in, I gained my composure and attempted to feed my dogs again about 1/2 hr later and the same thing happened again! I freaked out and woke up my husband which I had never done before over a sound (and we've lived here secluded on the banks of rough river since 1994 - so I'm used to bobcats, coyotes and various other creatures. This was not like any I had heard except for the show. Anyway, I just mustered up the courage to go where I thought the sound came from and there were foot prints - very large and they looked like they had two big toes. Also, I have trained SAR tracking and AKC certified tracking bloodhounds and scented them from the track. They work the track for about twenty minutes and came up on a track and stopped dead in their tracks and refused to go any further (which they have NEVER done before). Anyway, I saw you show yesterday on iTunes and it hit me that I had to go look.",
