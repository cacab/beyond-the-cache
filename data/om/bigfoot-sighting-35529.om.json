  "observed": "While driving through the Ocala National Forest in Fl on Highway 19 a couple of years ago, I look from my car window to the right and saw what I believe was a big foot looking back at me.  It was in a cleared area that had probably been controlled burned at some point, so I clearly could see a figure covered with dark brown fur from head to toe.  It stood about seven feet tall and had the shape of a man, not a monkey.  It was broad in the shoulders and narrower at the waist.  It gazed at me half behind a tree, not shy or fearful, but as if it was in its own element and it was noticing me driving by on the highway.  It moved behind the tree out of my sight as I drove by.  There is never much traffic on this road thru the forest. I never saw it again on any trips.",
