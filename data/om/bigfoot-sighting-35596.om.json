  "observed": "Resort manager and her friend were just completing their evening hike when they saw a \"greyish\" animal running past them at a speed so fast that at first they couldn't imagine what it would be.  It was standing up-right while running and was \"huge\".  I asked them to estimate its height but they didn't know other than it seemed to be a lot taller than them.  Probably at least 7' tall. They described it as \"human looking\".  I will encourage them to post the details themselves in the morning.",
