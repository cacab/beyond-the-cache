  "observed": "My cousin and I were riding four wheelers through the woods along Breakneck Rd. and all of the sudden a brown furry creature dashed across the path in front of us by about twenty yards or so the whole incident lasted about 3-5 seconds. At first after we gained our wits, my cousin asked me if that was a bear, but I said it could not have been because it was around eight foot tall and running very fast on two legs.",
