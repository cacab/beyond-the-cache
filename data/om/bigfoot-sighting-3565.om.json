  "observed": "This covers a couple of incidents over several of years that in retrospect may add up to some type of big foot activity. In 84 a friend and I were night fishing in Meadowgrounds lake at around 2300 we could here a dogs barking in sequence as something was travelling around south west the edge of the gameland which there are a few houses. Then we heard what I could best discribe as a roar that echoed across the small valley. My friend and I looked at each other and said what was that. We both are very familiar with the animals of Pa. I have had bobcats circle me at night and often heard thier cry while camping. Niether of us have ever heard a noise like that. Except for us there was complete quiet after the roar. 94. One of my hobbies is rock climbing. I like to scout for unclimbed rock . I was told by a friend that there was some large cliffs behind his house on 655 which borders the Game Land. I hiked up what passed for a trail through steep dense cover. The rocks are visible from the road and looked promising. I was dissapointed to find the rock to be loose and steppy. Not what rock jock wants after a very tough bushwack. Being a hunter I was also checking game sighns. I found 4 or 5 deer within 100 yards or so of each other did not appear to be shot or attacked by dogs but abdominal cavities were open.",
