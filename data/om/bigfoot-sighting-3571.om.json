  "observed": "While returning from a grassy field located off of an old DER road, I had the feeling that I was being watched. I also noticed a stong smell of what can only be described as a cross between body odor and a wet dog. I was facing upwind of the smell when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, moving paralell to the DER road. I could not get a good look at it, but it was bigger than a bear and moving faster than one. Whatever it was, it sure was not shy about making noise moving through the dense woods. I did not stick around long enough to look for tracks, daylight was short and all I had was a .22 rifle.",
