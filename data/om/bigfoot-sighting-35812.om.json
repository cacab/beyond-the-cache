  "observed": "June 2nd saturday my Mom & I wanted to go back to a place that she had done a BFRO expedtion. She said it had been pretty active,& she wanted to show me around in the day light hours.We met 2 of her Big footer friends on the way down. They drove their own jeep. We were going to the last spot that my mom wanted to show me.She said that it was the one spot that she had got creeped out while on the expedition at night. She also wanted to see this road going down to a clearing in the day time. Just after we had gotten to the spot that she was talking about,we heard a really weird loud whistle-whine-gurgling sound in the brush off to the right of us about 60 feet from us. I was ahead of my Mom by 10 feet or so. We stopped because it surprised us & held real still. The sound stopped....we started to walk again & the sound was louder & got more strange.Like a wild pig that was whisteling under water this time.There were also 3 loud human whistles from the other side of the road, up the hill & father away.I wanted to see what was making this sound & was hoping it was a bigfoot!I went closer to the pig sound & my Mom yelled at me to get back to her.2 trees were shaking now around the pig sound in the bushes.My Mom's friends were driving down with thier jeep to meet us & my Mom was flagging them down.I really really HAD to see what it was ,so I ran to the sound.My Mom was really scared & mad at me. But I am glad that I went to the noises, because I got to see what was making it.When I yelled at my Mom that I was looking right at a little Bigfoot,It stopped making the sounds, let go of the trees & turned around(away from me)I think it hit 2 trees with it's hands or fists on the way,because there were 2 very very loud thuds & the trees shook.It moved really fast into the under growth & it looked like it got down on all fours as it ran away very fast & made all kinds of crashing sounds. The whisteling on the other side of the road started again & the friends of my Mom's got to hear it too.After it ran away all noises stopped & it was dead silent.",
