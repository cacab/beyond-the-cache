  "observed": "I'm posting this on behalf of my wife, on a friend's computer.  Recently my family relocated to land that we own -- upon which we are in the process of bulding a new house.  Despite the noise of nailguns, etc., as weird as it might appear, my wife claims that at approx 4:30pm CST, on the last Saturday of the year, 29th?, she went for a walk in the woods.  This was not an ordinary walk, because we live right at the edge of a forest/woods that surrounds a lake.  We are located  NW of Paris, Texas, in Lamar County.  Anyways, she went for this walk in the woods because it was her first walk of the season. We are affraid to go down into the woods during the summer, as it is snake infested.   So we usually wait until it freezes before we venture...   It was down around 30 to 40 degrees that day.  Our land is a pretty chunk of property.  It backs up within 1/2 mile of the lake.  We are the last owners on our road.  Uncle Sam is our neighbor.  I believe the land is part of the State of Texas' Wildlife Management land, and the Army Corp of Engineers, actually built and own the lake.  My friend is telling me now that the area adjoining this lake  is approx 19,000 acres +.  Anyways, thats the rough conditions here in Lamar County.  Heavily wooded and open pasture mix.  Lots of snakes.  Moderate climate. My wife walked approx. one hundred yards down to a creek below our property, stopped and sat on a natural log bridge, suspended over this small ten foot creek, which drains down to the lake, usually having a steady but small amount of water.  Lots of moss, dead trees, gnarly grapevines, etc., type-setting.  She claims that she was looking into the binoculars and saw a \"large monkey looking creature.\"  The funny thing was that she told me also that \"it couldn't have been a Bigfoot, cause' it was only about your size...\"  (I'm approx 6 foot4, and 240 lbs. and big and hairy myself!!)  So she admitted her perception of Bigfoot is like 8 or 9 feet- maybe he is, maybe he isn't- I don't claim to know.  Anyways, that's what she saw.  She says that she observed it through binoculars on two feet, and in stride, freeze, and come to a standstill stance that was the forward leg was bent at knee, and back leg trailing- arms (at least one) out along same plane, like literally freezing in stride while sort of stooping.  This is the way she described it to me, and is consistent with my own perception of what I would imagine a stance taken by someone or an animal when alerted, and when that something goes into freeze mode (hand-in-cookie-jar stance.)  Anyways, that's what she described.  No view of head.  She said she spotted with binocs, put them down and looked unaided, returned to binocs again and observed again, looked unaided again, but was gone when she looked through the third time.  She said that she got a little scared, but remained there for some time, and could not hear it, nor saw it again. My gut reaction is that she may have saw a Sasquatch, Bigfoot.  She is pretty straightup lady.  She has her own small business- we work hard.  Drink moderately hard, party some, raise a child, work, work. Over the years, I have heard walking in the woods which never revealed itself.  Although there is some hunting, it is not as much as one would suspect.  You have to \"draw\" to be able to legally hunt back there, and there are a lots of better places to hunt around here.  Mainly fishermen.   Also, I have talked to other individuals who also claim to have had first- hand or second-hand experiences in the general area, over the past 20 years.  I'll be willing to talk to someone with credentials.  You can contact me through my friend at his email addy.",
