  "observed": "My 9 yr old son & I were traveling on TN Rd 61 in Roane County outside of Harriman TN, at about 345pm on Tuesday, June 19, 2012 when about 10 -12 car lengths in front of us a Large Black Hairy upright Person? Bigfoot, crossed the 2 lane road. It came out of the forest on the other side of the road & crossed in about 3 steps before looking over at us then entering the brush before the forest. Looked as thou it was 8ft tall or larger. I was able to go back today 6-26-2012, to look at the site where very large foot markings marked in the grass & a large bedded down grass area that looked very fresh. As we drove by on the 19th we looked more into the forest to see him, but saw nothing. I feel today after reseeing the spot where it crossed the road & we being very close laid down low in the grass & shrubs till we passed by. From the grass bed the brush was broke & disturbed into the forest.",
