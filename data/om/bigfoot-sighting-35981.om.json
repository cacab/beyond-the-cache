  "observed": "I was fishing behind the fish hatchery in Ft. Chiswell my friend and me where coming out at dusk when it was getting dark I said, \"we need to go I don't want to be out here at night\" so we were walking down the trail so we get out of the forest, I was feeling very weird at this time because something didn't feel right to me it felt like someone was following as you already know you can tell if someone or something is looking at you, so I let my friend out of the tree line first because I always do that and when I was coming out I heard a crash in the woods it sounded like something crashed down from the tree I turn around and saw a dark figure standing in the trail we just got off of, my friend was 30 ft in front of me when he heard the thing that was in the woods he ran. I was brisk fully walking backwards and pulled my knife out I was in fear for my life from what I saw whatever it was stood I say around 7 to 8 ft tall I only saw the silhouette of it it was very tall and very broad across the shoulders, I saw it for about 3 to 4 seconds and ran to my left with incredible speed and I ran to the truck in fear for my life. On a later incident I was carp fishing near the river behind the fish hatchery again, I had 2 other friends with me I will not mention any of my friends names because they don't want to be included in what happened, and something threw what I believe was a rock at us I was scared but we left a few hours later because I was getting worried.",
