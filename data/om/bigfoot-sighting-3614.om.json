  "observed": "The incident occured in 1985-86 not sure which.  A friend and I went into the woods to stay the night in a cabin by a small creek that my friends brother had built.  The cabins floor was about two feet off the ground to prevent flooding.  It was about 11:00 pm when my friend and I heard someone at the door which we had locked.  Someone was trying to get in.  When we asked who was there, no one answered.  Whoever or whatever it was moved around to the side of the cabin where the window was.  All we saw was a shape in the window.  The top of the figures head reached almost to the top of the window, which I estimated to be some 8 feet off the ground outside.  We were terrified beyond belief.  We huddled in a corner not getting a wink of sleep all night.  The next morning we cautiously went outside to investigate.  The ground was frozen with patches of snow that were riddled with footprints from everyone the day before.  It wasnt until I crossed the stream that I noticed a set of footprints that looked like someone had walked barefoot up the side of a steep embankment that ran along side the creek.  I called my friend over to look.  The stride was to wide for either of us to make especially since they were going up the embankment.  We just figured that someone had come in the middle of the night to mess with us.  At the time there were snow shoes that looked like a big version of someones bare foot circulating department stores.  I guess neither of us wanted to believe that it could've been anything else.  To this day no one has confessed to trying to scare us that night.  It just makes me wonder.",
