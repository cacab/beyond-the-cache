  "observed": "So after a night of hanging out in Lake Stevens couple friends and my older brother and I decided to go out driving on the Mountain Loop Highway. We had been doing this for about a week. The first time was Friday 17th I had heard some Whoops. Then tonight, Thursday 23 on the same road, National Service Road (edited) I had brought 3 guys and my older brother to the same exact place and we decided to stop a bit and look around, not getting out of the car. I had heard a little bit of Howls and a whoop. At around 10:45 pm I started talking about my first time out there mentioning Eye Shine, then my brother said \"Like those ones over there?\" WE all look out the window there had to have been at least 8 pairs staring back at us. The driver had mentioned how he had been seeing eye shines for a while by then. One of our passengers was extremely scared which then the driver decided it was better to clear out of there and rethink it. WE are planning on returning on Saturday the 25th night time around 10 pm with video cameras, possibly some night vision equipment, and audio files.",
