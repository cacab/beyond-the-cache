  "observed": "My experience happened a few years ago on a logging road between Wishkah, WA and Montesano,WA. The logging road we were on takes you out to the Wynoochie lake. A friend of mine and I were driving out to meet some friends who were camping. They were a few miles back off the paved road. We stopped the truck to get out and check the bed to make sure we had everything before we got too deep out in the woods. Like food, beverages etc.. It was just getting dark so we had the headlights on and the dome light lit up everything around us, so we couldn't see a few feet (10+ or so from the truck). We both get in the truck about the same time and close the doors, dome light goes off and we notice something standing roughly 15-20' ahead of us, in the middle of a single lane logging road. We were in a lifted Toyota Tacoma, I'm about 6'4 and the truck was taller than me. What we saw was grey-ish brown colored and fully covered in hair. The part of the road we were parked was cut out from a small hill. The banks were roughly 6' high on each side of the road. Before we could take a picture, honk, do anything at all, from a standing position it jumped up and was up and over the bank. The headlights didn't show the exact height but in my guess it had to be at LEAST 7'. I'm over 200lbs and it made me look like a baby. To this day, I still haven't gone down that logging road. If you'd like to know the exact place, it is called the A-Line on top of 13 corners. We were traveling from Wishkah side so the road was on our left. I've always been a believer in Sasquatch, my grandpa was a logger a long long time ago and actually worked while they were building roads to the dam. He told me all about the weird knocks, sounds that he would hear while staying in the cabins out there. I'm in my mid 20's and have lived in the country for the past 10 years. Love camping and being in the outdoors. I tell all my friends about my experience and still after all these years it still gives me goosebumps when I tell it. I'll never forget that.",

There is no sign postings for the logging road but it is the last pull over area on the left side of the road before you start going down the hill.",
