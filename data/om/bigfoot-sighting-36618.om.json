  "observed": "I had hiked up to Echo Lake along the Greenwater Echo Lake trail near Greenwater Washington. I and my friend had setup camp for the night along the northern edge of the lake. I woke up around 2 am to hearing very large stomping going through my camp. It sounded like \"stomp stomp stomp stomp\" and I could hear branches being broken as it was walking. I have never heard anything walk so loudly and it seemed to be moving quickly It sounded like it was heavy and was on 2 legs.. What terrified me is that i had reacted to the sound of the stomping by moving to grab my knife. The stomping then stopped and it went quiet. I felt like I was being watched. I didnt have my rainfly on over the tent. I was to afraid to look out and was trying to stay as still as I could in my sleeping bag. After what seemed like hours of waiting, I finally fell back asleep. My friend thought he heard loud foot steps durring the night while I was asleep.",
