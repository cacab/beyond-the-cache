  "observed": "On August 30 2012 between 9:07-9:45pm. I was traveling to my father's home in the Moyers area of Pendleton county, WV. I decided to stop along side of a small road, county rt 25 Moyers Gap rd. I stopped half way up Hoover mountian when I heard an unusual howl sounding like three woops (I'm pretty certain it was three). Being familiar with both wild animal sounds and those of farm animals I was startled because I immediately thought of sounds I've heard Bobo make on the show. I cupped my hands around my mouth and attempted to recreate the sound i just heard. I gave three loud woop sounds in medium tempo. After about 5-10 seconds I heard two woop sounds coming from the same direction as the first down over the mountain to my left. Again I cupped my hands and let out two loud woop sounds in about the same tempo as i had just heard. This time I heard a sharp crack of wood and a different type of howl, it sounded angry or frustrated maybe? to me. Unfortunately, a white gmc pick up truck began coming down the mountain. The loud crack and howl were the last sounds I heard that night. I waited for about 45 minutes in the truck I was driving, several times I attempted to get responses by making woop sounds none of my calls were returned again. I was so excited by this encounter. I will never forget it",
