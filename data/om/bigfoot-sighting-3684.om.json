  "observed": "This happened when I was 12 years old, so that had to be in 1950. I was camping in Los Padres National Forest. I was riding along a hill following a trail down to water in the Sespy River. About 50 yards from the streem, I saw 3 Big Foots geting a drink. I knew bears and monkeys,but this was something I had never seen before. I just sat still on my horse and when they saw me, I raised my hand as if to say hi. The largest one raised her hand and in a little while, she took each of the 2 little ones by the hand and walked up the trail. I waited a little while so as not to scare them then rode on down to the streem to give my horse a drink. The big one was about the size of a teenager. I think she was baby siting the 2 little ones. They all had redish brown hair but not on their faces or hands. The teanage one had the begenning of brests. They did not seem to be afraid of me in any way. When my horse finished drinking, I rode on up the trail but didn't see any sign of them. This is all true. I have told a few people but they said I was lying. Thats why I have never told this until now. I think people should leve the alone, but know they won't.",
