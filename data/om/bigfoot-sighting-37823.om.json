  "observed": "I lived in the swampy woods surrounded by stateland in Michigan.  I absolutely love walking through the trails in the woods, the solitude of it.  So my feelings that I was not alone in the woods started when I was 15 and I got into a fight with my dad and took off into the woods.  I got lost.  It became dusk and started to rain.  I sat on a fallen tree and sobbed.  Then, like a switch was turned, I felt like I was being watched.  It was so unnerving I looked around, then just ran.  I did get out of the woods, but it was after dark. Fast forward to age 18. I was pregnant and walking down the road with my boyfriend.  It was dark and we both felt like we were being watched.  I thought it might be a bear, because a neighbor of ours had a black bear in captivity and it had gotten out.  We never saw anything though. When my son is one week old.  I'm feeding him during the middle of the night, we are alone in the house on the sofa in front of the big window in the living room, and suddenly there were 5 knocks on the side of the house!  I didn't see anything when I looked. One week later, I got up during the night, again to feed my son who was crying, and when he was put back to bed I went to my own room.  I had a waterbed and because I had had a c-section, it was difficult getting in and out of the bed... so I was sitting on the wood side of the bed, looking down at my sleeping boyfriend.  I felt that feeling again at the same moment I heard this thing grunt/growl.  It sounded loud, yet muted, very guttual.  I turned to the window and saw it.  It was looking into a window that had to be 9 ft up... I lived in a mobile home, this was a typical window for trailers.  I only had a nightlight on in the hallway, and it was dark outside, but I could still see it for the most part.  The size of the head was huge.  Covered in reddish brown hair (at least that's what the color looked like in the low light), a little bit long- not like dog fur or anything, more like a medium haired cat has longish hair. The hair was covering the whole of it's face from what I could make out. The nose was very wide with huge nostrils.  It absolutely looked pissed off.  It was staring at my boyfriend. I froze to the spot.  I couldn't even breathe.  Then it was gone.  It took awhile before I could speak... I have no idea- several moments.  I was so scared that when I tried to speak I was stuttering and breathing frantically. Of course my boyfriend didn't get up, hence he is now an ex... but the next day we did walk around the house looking for blocks or something that someone could have stood up on to look inside, but found nothing.  It was rainy out that night, but we couldn't see any tracks of either shoes or feet because the ground was covered in layers of dead leaves. I believe that I saw bigfoot that night.  I believe he was, indeed, pissed off because he saw my boyfriend in my bed.  I believe he found me when I was 15 and had 'followed' me since. Either that, or he (or she) was investigating my crying infant. So, I believe your search for bigfoot using a crying baby might actually help you out if you tried it more often. ??",
