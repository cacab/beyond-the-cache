  "observed": "Saturday morning, 12/1/2012, as I was getting my deer hunting gear out of the truck at around 4:30 a.m. and about to head down the trail in the dark I heard a tree knock not too far away. So Terri (my wife) and I went back there the next afternoon to do our own Bigfoot research and also so I could further investigate some good deer sign (a lot of food for Bigfoot) and mark a few locations for future deer hunting. We no sooner left the truck and started down the mountain on an old logging road and I glanced up and to the left and there he was a couple hundred yards away just standing there partially behind a tree watching us. We got a very eery feeling and as we were trying to figure out what to do next we looked back up there and it was gone. Needless to say our walk was over and we hurredly went back to the truck and got out of there.",
