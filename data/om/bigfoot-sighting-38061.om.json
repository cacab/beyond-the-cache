  "observed": "On November 6, 2012 I was walking our 106 acres located in central Alpena County. It had just snowed (1-2\") the day before. While on one of our many paths I came across large tracks that were not like anything I've seen before. Later upon notifying my south neighbor, he also found the same type of tracks. They were 5.5\" X 10\"; flat without any toe or craw marks. The gait from toe to heal was 20\" and walked in a straight line. This animal walked through dense forest and underbrush which a human would (normally) not enter. 12-15 DNR personnel have viewed the pictures of these tracks and agree that they represent no animal that is recognized in Michigan. I am an experienced outdoor person; have hunted bears and deer in this area. In October I also noted an area in one of our food plots (wheat) large tracks. An area approximately 20 feet in radius was torn up. Pictures are available of the Fall and Winter tracks.",
