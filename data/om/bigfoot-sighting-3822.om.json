  "observed": "Well about 2 years ago, I heard strange noises while camping at Suger Pine Campground.  I heard \"whooping\" sounds and long \"wails\" coming from the forest behind me.  They scared me, so I ran into my trailer with my dad and step mom.  I didn't know that this could be a Bigfoot until just last week end, when I found out that I was going to be camping this summer at Smith River (I heard that the most recent sighting was 8 months ago). I came to this website and read about the sightings in the Sugar Pine area and heard the Bigfoot screams.  I realized that was the sound that I heard and it was in fact the famous wails and whooping sounds of sasquatch!  Bigfoot does exist!  The next year (2001; I go every year) I found what looked like humungus human tracks but with only 4 toes (I am not positive they were related to Bigfoot though).",
