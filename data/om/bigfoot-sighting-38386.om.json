  "observed": "I parked up the road a ways so any cops or ranger patrols didn't see my car. It was 1am with a 3/4 moon. The water was very low this day. I was fishing and there was about 4 Beaver-Tail slaps on the water so I knew there would'nt be any smallies hanging around. I took a few more casts and caught a Dace. Its like a sucker with the body of a trout. Very silver in color and unedible. I was trying to get the fish off my hooks when I heard something heavy about 45 yrds away from me cracking sticks as it approached from the road onto the freshly cut brush (from the work they did around there, days prior). It sounded like a human walking, and I thought I was in trouble with the law. My flashlight was dying and I was having trouble seeing just getting the fish off my 2 treble hooks. I asked, \"Who's There?!?!\" and I just heard a stick snap really loud as it stood still. I hit my flashlight in order to make it brighter and I seen big eyeshine and a dark sillouette of what looked to be shoulders. I started yelling at it to get out of here and at this point, I'm thinking deer... or worse, maybe a bear standing up. I heard a few more big snaps as it walked onto the paved road and that's when it cried out in this terrible noise that I've never heard before. It echoed thru the mountains and it scared the bajesus out of me. It wasn't a bear, or a deer, that's for sure. It was huge, and the sound it made sounded like a shrieking demon baby. That's the only way I could describe it. A loud shrieking howl. It wasn't a roar or a deep growl. It was more high pitched. I cut my line with the lure still in the fishes mouth and kicked the fish half hazardly into the water and ran as fast as I could to my car which was the scariest run/walk/stop & listen journey to my car I've ever encountered in my life. I was waiting for a werewolf to jump out and get me or something. True terror that I've never experienced to this day.",

  "location_details": "After 9-11, the government closed the thru-way that runs along side the reservoir that feeds Springfield its water supply. These mountains have been off-limits to hunters, hikers, fisherman, and the public for years before 9-11. Now its completely blocked off. Lots of deer and wildlife in this large expanse of protected mountainous terrain. The Reservoir holds lots of Small-Mouth bass, Rainbow, Brook, and Brown Trout. My Uncle, worked at the Pumping Station, he let me and my cousins fish there. I stayed there for weeks at a time. As an adult, I couldn't help myself to go fishing there still.   I respected the land and put all fish back and wouldn't throw any trash around. I packed it up and brought it back with me. I fished there all day sometimes but mostly at night with top-water poppers for Small-Mouth bass. Fun,fun!",
