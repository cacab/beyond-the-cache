  "observed": "I have had two incidents in the last few months. The first happened one morning when I woke up early and had to use the rest room. On the way back to bed, I looked out the back door to see the sunrise, and check if the dog was in the back yard. I watched a large, dark person or thing cross the field from one treeline to another. The second happened on the night of the meteor shower just a few weeks ago. I walked outside to look up and watch the shower. I stood there for several minutes before I looked down, directly on the other side of the fence was a large form. After I screamed my head off, it bolted to the tree line.",
