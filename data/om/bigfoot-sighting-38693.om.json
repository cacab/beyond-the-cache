  "observed": "We bought a new home 2 months ago. It has 5 acres and close to a wild life preserve/park. My husband was the first to tell me he heard something weird. He said it sounded like an owl, but not an owl. I thought he was being silly and ignored it. About 2 weeks ago my husband and I were getting home from a date night (1230 am or so) and I heard the most terrifying sound. It was a shriek similar to the one the female on the Bigfoot hunter show has made (not exactly same but close enough to raise the hair on my back) .My husband said \"that's it! Did you hear it??\" I tried to stay calm and told him it was probably some kids joking around. I didn't want to tell him what I really thought. I've been woken several times since by the same scream and a few nights ago I woke to what sounded like rocks being thrown at our house. I was too scared to look out the window. This was supposed to be our dream home and now I'm terrified to go in our backyard.not sure what to do. If there is some way to get rid of it or make it move on I'd love to know how.",
