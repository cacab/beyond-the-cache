  "observed": "Me and my neighbor were sitting in a hunting blind for about 2 1/2 hours when the woods suddenly went quiet. Then we heard some crashing in the bushes about 300 yards away. So I told my neighbor to put on his walker game ear headphones. I thought it was pigs and was curious to see if he could pinpoint where they were but the crashing got louder and he said the foot steps sounded like a man's gait, 2 legs then all the sudden a big boom and then the loudest and creepiest howl I ever heard nothing like a man or animal I've ever heard. So we sat till after dark hoping to see it then we packed up and began walking back to the boat, we got about 200 yards down the dirt road we were walking and I decided to turn around and 50 yards behind me is the glint of eyes about 7 feet off the ground, and it turned away and ran.",
