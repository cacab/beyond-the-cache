  "observed": "We have lived in Freedom Township, Portage County Ohio, since 2000. In a wooded area right across from a creek. We have heard in the spring time of the year a sound like a whoop...it was always at dusk, and into the night. It sounded ape-like...it would just go whoop, whoop, whoop, and just keep doing that. Our family would stand outside and listen! We have only heard it the spring of the year and at dusk into dark. We also heard a screaming, high pitched howl coming from the creek, late at night! This was in the dead of winter and we could hear it, from inside the house. It was like it was moving up and down the creekbed. We joked as a family and said the howl was must be coming from a manic coyote...we only heard that screaming howl that winter...maybe about 3 or 4 times. It was frightening, as I have dogs and whatever was making the sound, I did not want it coming after my dogs! My daughter also reminded me of something that happened about 12 years ago...we found a very large footprint by the barn...it looked like a human foot, but toes deformed like...we only found one...she also remember when we found the footprints there had been a sound of screaming and crying and wailing coming from deep in the woods...we all saw the footprint and heard the wailing...Ii think what we are hearing is a bigfoot We never thought about a bigfoot making these sounds...but my husband was on youtube and and came across a video on bigfoot, we watched it and then he pulled up a video on bigfoot vocals and we heard the whoop and scream...it sounded like what we have heard! Then I found out Portage County has seen sightings of bigfoot. Just wanted to share this with someone who believes what we have heard. Thank you,",
