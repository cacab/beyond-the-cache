  "observed": "I look for deer all the time when I drive anywhere. I was on my way home after school from LLCC. On the UIS soccer fields there was something at the edge of the field at the tree line. I glanced away and back and it was gone. It was a human shape but the shape from the head to the body was flowing with long hair all over. It was about 8 feet tall brown in color but was in the shade of the trees. Later that day is when the youth soccer league plays games there in the fields.",
