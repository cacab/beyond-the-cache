  "observed": "My friend had taken me to potter co. PA to see if I was interested in joining his camp.   We had been there two days and were getting ready to leave.   I was going out to the jeep when we heard this gutteral scream of the likes of which neither of us had ever heard before.  I grew up in WV and have spent half my life in the woods both night and day and have never heard a sound like that.   We just heard it once and haven't heard it again,  but in the fall of the next year I saw tracks crossing a frost covered field where something had taken very long strides.  There were no indented tracks because the ground was frozen.",
