  "observed": "We were at Octoberfest in October 1998 at Great Gorge in Vernon NJ.  We were out on the back deck which boarders the mountains and the golf course.  My brother in law and sister with me.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw an approximately 7 1/2 - 8 foot large figure that walked with a long steady gate,  with long arms and a thick chest.  It walked steadily down the mountain side glancing at us and continuing to walk.  We all looked at each other before running inside.  We all saw the exact same thing.",
