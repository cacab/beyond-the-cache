  "observed": "Hello, I live in Millersburg Ohio. On June 21st 2012, I was driving home from a nearby town called Loudenville on state route 39 going east toward Millersburg. West of a very small town called Nashville, on a straight away in the road, I saw something on the side of the road. I couldn't tell what it was for sure but thought it might be a man walking there. As I neared, whatever it was crossed the road (from left to right) a ways in front of me. What was weird is that I could tell it was there, but it seemed to blend into the woods, so it looked like a dark figure. It only took only three steps to cross the two lane highway. I slowed down as I passed the place it crossed and looked to my right where it had gone. By then I was almost stopped. When I looked up on the bank there was what I thought a man walking in the field...but as i looked I saw it was very big, and hairy. I thought it may be a hunter....but no clothes, no gun. I could see the hair shimmer as it walked. This thing walked like a man. It never turned around but kept on walking toward the tree line...it had hair from head to foot...it swung its right arm as it strode away and seemed to be unconcerned that I was there.  I got really scared that it might turn around so I drove away to the town of Nashville and called my son. No one believed my account until months later when I stopped at the farm where the field was...I told them what I had seen and assured them I wasn't crazy or a storyteller. To my surprise I had been the third person to come to them with almost the same account...they asked if I thought it could have been a bear....\"No, beyond a shadow of a doubt....NO\". There is a game trail coming from the left where I first saw it. And one of the people who saw it went with the farmer to investigate but didn't find anything. I know what I saw...I keep journals and wrote it down the day after the incident.",
