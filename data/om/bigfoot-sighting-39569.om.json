  "observed": "When I was probably ten years old was the very first time I ever seen it. I saw the back motion light come on, I ran back to the back bedroom and peeked through the blinds. It was digging in the trash cans, burn barrel and eating and taking the trash bags and throwing them on the ground and digging around again. I then ran back to my own bedroom. I never told anyone until about two years ago.",
