  "observed": "My wife actually saw a bigfoot one evening getting close to dark. We were sitting in the car talking while we were dating. And she saw one standing behind the car. We were talking and she all of a sudden shut up, turned white as a ghost, and turned back around. I asked her what was wrong and she said \"I saw one standing behind the car\". As soon as she looked at it, it started moving back away. By the time we both looked back around it was gone. I've seen total evidence, my mother has seen them, and my wife has seen them.",
