  "observed": "My experience happened late June to early July of 2012.  Rural Christian County.  Between 8:00 and 9:00 pm.  I was relaxing by the fire texting and listening to my ipod. Watching a few cars pass the house.  To my left was the farmhouse, to my right was the driveway and a few out buildings plus tall weeds (about 4 feet tall) in an old pasture. Several feet behind me was the pole light and machine shed. I felt an eerie sensation to my right.  I looked in that direction.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I could have sworn I saw an outline of a head and shoulders above the weeds.  I continued to look in that direction and shrugged it off as my imagination.  I went back to texting.  Glancing to the same spot occasionally. I kept hearing a slight noise to my right. And I would look up. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a rolling limestone rock.  I didn't think about it at first.  Then I realized that rocks don't move by themselves.  I was freaked out and went inside. The next morning I went to investigate what could have formed the shape I saw.  Nothing was there.  I did find several sticks, corn stocks, and dirt clods in the driveway.",
