  "observed": "I was driving home from town, to my parents house in southwest Parker County, when I came to the turn off to go down their road. I saw something big to the left of the road. It was dark brown or black and was standing up next to a tree.  It must have been 7 or 8 foot tall. It looked like it was eating leaves off a tree or something. As I drove up to the turnoff, it ran back (on 2 legs) into more trees, toward my parents home. I was afraid to get out of the car when I reached the house, thinking this thing could be right behind me. This memory has always haunted me. I do not lilke going down to my parents house at night any more, for fear something is living around that area. My parents house is about 1 to 1 1/2 miles from the Brazos river.",
