  "observed": "About the middle of Oct 2012 on my way to work I was heading west on 54 Highway from Nevada MO to Fort Scott KS to travel north on 69 North to the La Cygne power plant. At a point on 54 between the railroad tracks that has an overpass and going west to the top of the hill at the state line my head lights caught something upright on two legs very big, very dark, step off the road to the south side, I only got a look for second but it sent chills up my back. I told my wife about it, she thought I was nuts for watching Finding Bigfoot too much tonight, then I read your website about a trucker in the same area seeing something on 54.",
