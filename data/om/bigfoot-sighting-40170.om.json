  "observed": "Loud screaming vocalization heard in Alberton Montana July 2008. I was asleep with my husband.  Approximately 3:30 AM.  We could hear it running across the property - aprox. 30 acres on the Clark Fork River. It screamed 4-5 times.  My husband grabbed his gun.  We had never heard anything like this.  In addition my mother saw in July 2009 what we call the strange hairy man on the property approx. 3:00 AM. It was taller than our 6 foot totem pole, long hair over the entire body, about 4 feet wide.  A dead rabbit was out front where the hairy man was seen.  I haven't reported sooner as family members don't want our location of the vacation cabin revealed.  Many elk use our property as a crossing.  At night one can hear the baby elk yelping.",
