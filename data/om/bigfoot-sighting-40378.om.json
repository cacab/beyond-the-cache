  "observed": "Here is something I've wanted to tell for years, but frankly my professional career as a writer would be in question, here it is... my-self and two lifelong friends were fishing at night on the Duckabush River in a canyon on the Olympic Peninsula. We were a quarter mile from the road, it was 1 am and we were standing on a large log, all three of us a few feet apart, casting. The river is approx. 100 feet across, the other side very steep, devils club, etc, going up into wilderness of the O.N.P. (Olympic National Park). The river erupted ten feet in front of us, a thunderous crack and then a soaking, knocking over one of our three lanterns. We each though one of us did it, then two more close together, \"crack-crack\", wall of water, soaking us. Then in the dim lantern light comes two watermelon sized rocks (how far could you throw one??) from the other side, two more thunderous splashes. My friend Mark said \"Look across the river!! What the @@#$ is that!! With just enough light we could see two huge figures standing on the ledge rock on the other side, swaying back and forth, eyes glowing turquoise green in the lantern light. The river was high and uncross-able from rainfall. We ran like hell, blindly down the thin fishing path downstream to one of the few gravel bars in the area. The instant we popped out on the bar, another huge rock lands in the water a few feet away. We ran out frightened to death, dove into my friendsâ€™ truck and sped home; we never spoke of this for years. It was the most scared I've ever been, my friend had just got out of the Navy, he was a bad a** and he was frozen in his tracks scared.  This was January 23rd, 1982. You never forget the day this @#$% happens.",
