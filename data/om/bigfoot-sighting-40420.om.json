  "observed": "Ok, this happened about 2 years ago or maybe 2 1/2. I live on 10 acres of woods. All around me is woods. I was just falling asleep during a cool summer night. The 3 dogs I have lived outside in their pen I built. The dogs bark now and then at night but usually quiet down, being that they are used to noises. They started barking that night so I sat up in bed and yelled \"no\". They stopped but after a few seconds they were barking very loud and unusual. I thought that it may have been a wild hog that we see every so often. I got up and heard some movement below my bedroom window, which is about 6 feet above the ground. I grabbed my 357 and stood up. I heard something like foot steps but they sounded like a very heavy person taking huge steps, but not running. I took off out the front door and turned the outside lights on with the dogs still barking wildly. I had a flashlight, pointed it where the steps were at, only to see nothing. But, I did smell a strong odor of a skunk but not that harsh smell. I laid back down a few minutes later and finally gathered my thoughts together and called 911. I was wondering how I was going to report this. I talked with the 911 operator and was kind nervous when talking with her. She laughed and said something like its OK, an officer will be there. I didn't want the officer coming to the house unless they were able to find something. No one came, so the next morning came I found myself looking for anything on the ground, no foot prints due to carpet grass that was pretty thick. No fur and no more smell.",
