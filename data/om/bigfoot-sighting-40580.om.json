  "observed": "I was in my kitchen looking out the small window above our sink. I was looking towards our woods to see what our 2 dogs were barking about. We usually always have deer around so I figured it was just some deer running thru the corn field to the woods behind us as, that was the direction the dogs were barking. As I'm looking I see movement along the first set of trees it's something big because I can only see the top half of it and it's moving to the south along the tree line. It was dark in color and had to be tall because the field kinda has a hill in front of the trees and I can see it walking along the trees. I didn't think anything of it but then I text my niece, she's big time into Bigfoot and after I heard back from her she started asking questions like is it hairy, could you see the muscles or buttocks? I laughed and said I think it was just a bear. Then she asked if it had arms swinging? I said yeah I could see that much of it. So she says its a Bigfoot, I still don't know for sure.",
