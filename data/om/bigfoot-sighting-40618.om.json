He arrived at my house and I asked him to take me back to that spot, when we arrived you can see his skid marks where he slid to try and keep from hitting it, we shined a light into the woods, that's when i seen it, it was at-least 9ft tall and 4ft wide, I myself didn't really believe in bigfoot until I seen it with my own eyes.......",
