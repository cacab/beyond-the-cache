  "observed": "I live in Lake Helen, Florida and we have had several incidents that I didn't put together until I ran across the story of the Cassadaga sightings. My daughter and I share our home with 2 golden retrievers and it's not uncommon for my female to not want to go outside to do her nightly business for no apparent reason. Now, maybe there is. My daughter and I were in my bedroom around 9pm one night, when something slapped the side of the house so hard it shook. We looked around outside, from inside and saw nothing. 3 days later at around 3 in the morning, my daughter in her bedroom (directly above my bedroom, sharing the outside wall) woke up to a loud, house shaking slam followed by a loud growl. Her feet hit the floor upstairs at the same time mine hit downstairs...We assumed a bear, but never could figure out why a bear would hit the house and how it could hit hard enough to shake the house, waking us both up.",
