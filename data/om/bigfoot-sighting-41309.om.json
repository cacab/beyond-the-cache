  "observed": "While bicycling on the Van Fleet trail on the North End, I saw 2 \"humans\" cross the trail about 200 yards ahead of me. They were both dark brown color from head to toe. The 1st was tall and quite big, well over 6 feet. The second was smaller and much lighter. Long arms and large head. They walked onto the tar trail, paused briefly to look at me coming, then ran off the trail. When I got to the spot they crossed, there was no trail to hike or run on and a very steep bank on the side they left on. It didn't take long to get to the spot, but they had completely gone out of sight. This trail goes through the Green Swamp, so there is not much around the area except swamp. It looked so much like Bigfoots, that I figured it must be a hoax.",
