  "observed": "Driving with family on Damascus Church Road in Alexander County I saw what appeared to be a Sasquatch.  I glanced over while driving at the top of a fenced-in cow pasture and I saw it.  It appeared tall over 7 foot and had long arms walking upright.  It had long hair all over that appeared all over the body and the hair must have been 6 plus inches.  It walked down a powerline clearing and veered off into the woods .  I was kind of in disbelief and told my family what I think I saw, turned around and it was gone into the woods.  I'm 38 years-old and first time I've seen anything like it.  This I saw about two weeks ago and only told family.",
