  "observed": "I had just picked up by daughter from Camp Sacajawea (L Ave) and had gone several miles west on E26 toward P70,  both paved roads. We had just crested a hill and I observed in the distance 1/2 mile ahead what appeared to be a dark upright figure walking along the north (right) side of the road on the gravel shoulder heading west up hill.  I thought it was unusual, someone would be walking along the road in this area. As I mentioned to my kids (daughter age 6 / son age 7) \"What is that?\" the figure glanced back our direction and began running, continuing west along the side of the road for a short distance, then it crossed the dividing line and continued uphill at a fast pace in the opposite lane. It then left the road going left/south up a short tractor access road and disappeared into a cornfield/wooded area. We were approx 100 yards away from it when we lost sight. At the closer distance it appeared overall dark and shaggy. My first impression was someone wearing a gillie suit. My son witnessed it.  My daughter sitting behind me in the truck did not.",
