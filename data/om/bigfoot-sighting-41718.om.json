  "observed": "My husband and I were on a motorcycle ride to Siloam Springs State Park. We were driving about 40 to 45 miles per hour on a blacktop coming down a hill when I thought I saw a burnt tree trunk ahead on my right.  As we got closer I noticed hair so I looked it up and down and what I was looking at really shocked me.  I could see his side view very clearly.  It had a human body larger than a man's and very muscular. It had dark reddish brown hair about 2 to 3 inches long all over except for the head and face which was grey and white and I could even see light flesh under it.  It was standing straight with arms down by its side I could even see its fingers. It was looking down at the ground and standing very still. The back of his head looked rounded, but from his side he had a pronounced brow area that slanted upward to the crown of his head. His head looked like it set directly on his shoulders, I didn't notice a neck.  His face didn't have much hair and his lips looked thin and wide. When we drove back by the spot where I saw it, about 20 minutes later, there was nothing there.",
