  "observed": "This happened almost 24 years ago, but it has never left me in all these years.  And I have never told anyone about these two incidents.  The first incident happened when I was bow deer hunting during the early season, as I remember that the leaves on the trees were still green.  I had returned to my car that was parked in a nearby field and got my hunting gear put away.  I then sat in my car waiting for about 10 minutes for my hunting friend to return so that we could go home. When he didn't return (he did return after the incident) I got out of my car and walked down close to the edge of the woods, maybe about 10 feet or so from the edge of the woods, shortly thereafter I heard something coming from my left just inside the woods edge.  It was making a lot of noise as it was walking through.  I thought this was my friend coming back, but then I thought that this  was “very odd” for my friend since he was really quiet in the woods.  As the “walker” was about right in front of me I called out my hunting friend's name to which I received a rather loud “guttural growl”.   But what ever the “walker” was it did not break stride, it just kept right on walking rather loudly away from me going parallel with the edge of the field just inside the woods edge.  I have listened to over and over again the bipedal walking audio on the BFRO website - http://www.bfro.net/avevid/sierrasounds/911.asp#bipedal . It sounded just like this, but add in some very loud branch breaking and you will be very close to what I heard that night!!!!! I'm 6' 2” tall, and when the “walker” did its loud “guttural growl” when it was right in front of me it sounded like it was at about the height that my head was at.  I would estimate that the place in the field  that I was standing at was about two feet higher than in the woods where the “walker” was at. The second incident that took place happened in the same location, but about 200 yards from where the first incident happened about a week, or so earlier.  Both times I had been hunting from the ground. The hunting friend that was with me from the earlier time was also there along with my sister's boyfriend.  We split up with about 3 hours of hunting time left.  It was really quiet for about the first hour, but then things started to change.  I heard all sorts of noises that I can't explain nor identify that happened in front of me from about my 10 o'clock position to about my 2 o'clock position.  I did see what appeared to be something walking into the thicker part of the woods.  This looked like the arms and legs of something going from the more open part of the woods, to the more thicker part and was about 40 yards away from my location. After seeing the arms and legs of whatever the things were, the tops of the smaller trees started swaying violently back and forth.  This went on and off for about a ½ hour to 45 minutes.  What really scared me was when the rocks started to be thrown in my direction.  The size started out as about golf ball size, and by the time that I “turned tail” the size was about softball size. I would describe the color of what I saw of the arms and legs to be about a rather dark red to almost black.",
