  "observed": "Early Saturday morning about 1:55am I went outside for a smoke before bed and it happened. I heard a clinking sound of the chain-link fence clinking on the bar-rail fence. At the very same time I heard the sound of the brush/bushes being smashed. I looked over in the direction of the sound and seen a leg hanging down. As I looked up I seen a large hairy back. The thing turned and looked right at me. Just after it made eye contact with me it pulled its leg right back up and over the fence. It actually used the bar of the top of the fence to leap back onto the brush/thicket area. It was huge, from what I could see. This is not my first encounter with what I believe was one. I was on a walk at around the same time of early morning a few months ago and actually felt something run by me on that same side of fence-row. As the thing ran by me I could feel the vibrations of it moving by me. It sounded like it was tearing through the thick brush with no problem at all. I didn't report this before because I didn't actually see it, only felt & heard it. However this time I know what I saw! No doubt in my mind. Even woke up my 25yr old daughter to come and try to see it. She heard it, and smelled it.",
