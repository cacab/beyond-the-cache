  "observed": "My sighting was 41 years ago at NW 21 Terr/NW 31 Ave in Gainesville Fl.  Back then it was mostly woods and I was going to see a neighbor at a slow jog, looked to my right and we were both surprised.  He was what I figure to be about 7 ft 6 in.  He had big dark round eyes, lots of hair and just stared at me till I took off.  No sound, he didn't come after me he just stared. I know it was a long time ago, but I did see Sasquatch.",
