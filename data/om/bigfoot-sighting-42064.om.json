About 200 ft. in front of me was an animal which I though was a black bear but this thing was as least 7 ft. tall and running on two legs. It stopped at the edge of the woods for maybe a couple seconds and twisted from the waist so that I seen its backside. Which was a very hairy and long armed animal. It had walked off into the woods. When I got to where it had stood I stopped and looked through the woods and I seen nothing, it was gone.",
