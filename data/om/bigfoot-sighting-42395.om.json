  "observed": "Last year in October around 6 pm. I was sitting at a stop sign at a T in the road. I looked to my left and saw something come out of the woods. As I watched this thing, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt immediate terror. I was too shocked and scared to even pick up my cell phone and take a picture of it. I watched it walk across the road to the other side of the woods. It was not a bear as it walked on 2 legs. It was not a human as I looked for shoes, hands, facial features. It was black and hairy with long arms. It has taken me so long to say anything to anyone as I never knew where to report it to. Plus I didn't want people to think I was crazy. It never looked at me  But just stared straight ahead. I told my husband about it and he didn't know what to think. I wanted to go check for footprints however I'm disabled and walking in the woods would be hard plus I was terrified as well.",
