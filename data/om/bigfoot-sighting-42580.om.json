  "observed": "It was mid august of 2012, me and my wife was driving around that night like we did a lot, on our way back to the house we rounded a curve on Ridge Rd in Seagrove NC when my headlights landed on a dark brown/black creature on 2 legs walking into the tree line, the creature had to be at least 7 1/2 ft tall and I would guess about 500+lbs by the width, it was a fast visual. But me and my wife both saw it. I have seen my father-in-law on the side of the road a few time he stands 6ft 4in and the creature I saw was more then a foot taller and a lot wider.",
