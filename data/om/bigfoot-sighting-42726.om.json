  "observed": "I was walking my dog on October 18th, at around 9:00 to 9:10....We had just got back from dinner. We live in a subdivision that backs to the Ocala National Forest. As I was walking towards the end of the subdivision, where there is nothing but open land and empty lots, with some sporadic trees. While turning around, I saw a figure crouching down.  It immediately caught me off guard and quite frankly scared the sh*t out of me.  The minute I spotted the figure, I pulled back on my dog and grabbed my gun.... (I have a permit to carry and we have had a lot of neighbors reporting bears and wildlife in this area) I backed away from the figure and yelled, \"I got a gun, I will shoot you....**and other things.. I had the leash in my left hand along with my flashlight.  As I shinned the flashlight at this figure again, I yelled at it again.. \"I will shoot you, I'm not kidding!\"  Thinking this was a hoax of some kind.  My light caught this figure's face and I got a reflective shine back at me.... The figure stood up and walked behind this small patch of trees.  This figure was huge.  Looked just like a large ape man, covered in hair. I pulled my dog back with me, and got the heck out of the area.  I didn't see where it went to after this.",
