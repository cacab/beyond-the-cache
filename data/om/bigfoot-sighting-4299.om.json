  "observed": "When a friend and I were training a hunting dog one night during the fall of 2000 our dog suddenly became very spooked and would not venture into the woods. We couldn't figure out what the dog's problem was. We stood puzzled for several minutes when suddenly there was a loud, deep throated shriek unlike anything either one of us had ever heard. The shriek came from a place no more than 200 yards from where we were. My friend and I were stunned for a few seconds and saw something huge and hairy walk through a nearby clearing. We could make out only the outline, but it was at least seven foot tall and very massive. The sighting occurred at Resthaven Wildlife Reserve which has no known bears or any large animals.",
