  "observed": "Three co workers and I were putting up communications lines on telephone poles in a bucket truck. We heard high-pitched sounds, almost like an ape, so I started to mimic the sounds. Just then, my co-worker asked me what kind of sound that was that I was making. Then, as he was up in the bucket, he said a man crossed the road. I thought he was just fooling around. As we hung more interduct, I noticed a large hairy animal which crossed the road. At first, I did not think anything of it, but this thing kept walking back and forth out to the middle of the road looking at me. I had my hand over my eyebrows trying to get a better look and to cut the glare off from the sun. This animal was not walking with a limp or bent over. To me, it walked straight up and down like a man. It was looking at me as if I had puzzled it with my impersonation. I would say it was a good 70 yards away. I tried to reason it to be a man, but all the men working in the area had hard hats on with reflective vests-us also.This thing was walking back and forth like you see a wild animal in the zoo. It did pause several times in the middle of the road to look at me, as if it had some kind of intelligence. For some reason I felt it was female. The arms were long and hung at the animal's side. The hips were wider than the shoulders",
