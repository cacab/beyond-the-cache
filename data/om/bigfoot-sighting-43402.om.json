  "observed": "I saw bigfoot twice in Chance, Alabama and my mom seen him also. He's been living down here far over thirty years. I'm forty seven years old and I remember riding my bicycle through there and hearing all the noise in the woods. I thought it was a big deer going through the woods until I got older. Now I know what it was if you want to see him let me know he's been there from 1980's when I was hearing him and I saw him in 1992 and 2002. One of our cousins said he thinks it was attracted to one of his horses in 2010. I know he's still there.",
