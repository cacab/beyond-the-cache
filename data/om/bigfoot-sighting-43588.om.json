  "observed": "Back in the early 90's I was deer hunting and watched one for over 15 minutes.  It appeared to be a young one and less than twenty yards from me. It was about five feet tall, its fur was kind of greenish grey/ black.  There was also a smell that I did not recognize, not bad but also not good. It looked at me also and seemed to be hiding behind a tree watching me in my tree, kind of like hide and seek maybe.  It showed no fear of me whatsoever and almost seemed to smile at me.  After watching one of your shows last season I realized that what I saw was not too far from where you were when you were in Grayling, MI.  I believe the guy you talked to was only a few miles from where I saw mine.  I also heard an unfamiliar sound that I have never heard before or since, but hard to explain. After the sound he/she turned and slowly walked away.  I know every animal in the Michigan woods and this was not one of them. There is not enough room here to explain everything I saw and heard.",
