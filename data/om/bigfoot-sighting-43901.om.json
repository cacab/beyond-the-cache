  "observed": "On Sunday night, January 19th 2014, last night approximately 9 p.m. I was returning home from the school house restaurant on route 670 north of Dyberry Pennsylvania, I was heading south coming down a hill and an oncoming car had his high beams on. I glanced away from the beams and when I looked back at the road I was coming to the bottom of a dip in the road and as I looked back at the road I saw TWO VERY LARGE LEGS WITH EXTREMELY LARGE FEET ATTACHED ! I saw three strides and it was across the road and the fourth step took it up a 7 foot bank. The fur appeared to be long and very dark, almost black but with a bit of a sheen to it. The fur appeared to go all the way to the ground around the feet. Because I was approaching the bottom of the dip, my headlights were only catching the very bottom of where the road came back up and he was at the very top of my headlight beams. I backed up and pulled out a light, looked for tracks through my car window. even though I am an experienced hunter and tracker, I felt goose bumps and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and I left after I locked the doors. I've seen many bears, three mountain lions, a fisher and many other wild animals in many areas. This was not a four legged creature.",
