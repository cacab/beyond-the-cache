  "observed": "The Wisconsin River runs right by my town.  I am an avid deer hunter, turkey hunter, fisherman and so on.  I have been in the woods my whole life (48 years old) in this area and I had never seen this before.  I was leaving to go deer hunting and I had just pulled onto the main highway along the river and started to accelerate when I looked down into the river bottoms where there are a lot of tops and trees and general river wash and sitting on a log was a what looked like a very large hairy man all dressed in a shaggy brown fur.  It was just coming daylight and I was doing about 20 miles an hour when I went by but its head was down in between its shoulder blades like and I remember that the legs just looked huge and the top of the head was cone shaped.  I got down to the intersection and turned around and went back but when I got back whatever was there was already gone.  There is a natural high bank bend in the river about 30 yards from where it was sitting so whatever it was could have moved under that and out of sight.  I have heard sounds that are on tape since I was a young boy coon hunting with my dad in these bottoms and my dad always said that something followed us while we were coon hunting the river bottoms but since it didn't bother us he never bothered it and that him and my uncle would often skin the coon right in the woods and leave the carcass for whatever was there.  They called the one valley north of us \"The Screaming Woman Valley\" because late at night in the late fall, early winter people used to hear screams from the bottoms that were often just put off as a bobcat or lynx. In 2012 I was not sure what I saw but as time goes on and I talk to people I am convinced that I saw a Sasquatch that morning.  Nothing else makes sense to me.",
