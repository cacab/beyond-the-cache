  "observed": "This was years ago and probably not significant now, I am now 60, this happened when I was 12. Myself, sister and 4 other neighbor kids had to walk about 3/4 of a mile from where the school bus dropped us off to our homes, the road was gravel, very few houses and far apart. We had just got dropped off by the bus and were walking home, as I was walking I happened to catch something out of the corner of my eye and turned around to see what it was, as I turned around a creature, that I now know as bigfoot, came up the side of the ditch. It was on all fours until it topped the edge of the ditch. The ditches were very deep probably 6 to 7 feet, and wide. I think it was laying on the side of the slope until we walked past, when it jumped on the road on 2 feet, it took a couple steps across the road, jumped the ditch on the opposite side, took another step or 2, put one hand on a wooden fence leaped over it and ran probably 1000 to 1500 feet across an open field, on two legs, upright. The fence was designed to hold ponies and I can remember I had to grab the upper wooden rail, put my foot on the middle rail and swing my leg on the top rail and climb down the other side. I was 12 so I would say the fence was around 5 foot high. This thing scaled it with ease, we all had a clear view of this beast, it ran across that field faster than the ponies could run. At that time I never heard of a bigfoot. I went home, told my dad what had happened, he went down and looked for tracks, thinking bear. No tracks found as it was mostly sandy ground. I wondered all my life what I had seen. About 20 years ago I seen a TV show about bigfoot and it dawned on me that was what I had seen. My sister can also remember the incident, she was 9. I would like to say this was completely covered with hair, I did not see its face, but it was not 8 or 9 feet tall, my best guess would put it at between 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet tall, I can still to this day see this happening in my memories like it was yesterday, this is probably not important ,been far too many years ago, but I thought I would share this with you anyway.",
