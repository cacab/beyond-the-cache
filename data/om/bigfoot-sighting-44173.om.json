  "observed": "2-4-14: 4 miles south of Piketon, OH at State Rest Area (north end) after 12\" overnight snow.  Stopped by rest area at 1600hrs to let dog out (Rhodesian Lab). Followed septic area fence line to towards back of area, turned north only to discover tracks in (3) path's from 5-7' spread.  BFRO was immediately contacted with Investigator Marc from Cleveland contacting me about the incident (he has field info.).  I returned to area 2-7-14 at 1330hrs & took numerous photos using items for scaling purposes.  A possible nest was also found at north end near ravine & wood line, again given to Marc at BFRO.  Marc returned call last night (2-7-14) saying his contact visited the area, found prints & documented spread & locations.  The field personnel were to return again today (2-8-14) to cast prints where toes were visible.  There was no way any other North American animal could've produced these tracks at 15.5\" & 5-7' increments.  I have several quality photos now that depict the event.",
