  "observed": "I was Deer hunting in Freedom Hills Management Area around coon dog cemetery. I entered the woods before daylight and walked down the access road next to a pine forest. I came to the back of some pines where they turned into heavy hardwoods. I sat down at the bottom of a tree and waited for daylight. During my way up, behind me on top of the ridge I heard a series of grunting and heavy movement through the woods walking down the ridge behind and down the ridge it went. Once daylight came I walked up to where I first heard the grunting and movement. As I got to the area I found bedding and hair. The hair I found I kept a sample and it wasn't wild hog or bear nor mountain lion. This whole incident scared me and made me very uneasy. Later that night we heard wood knocks and a tree pushed down.",
