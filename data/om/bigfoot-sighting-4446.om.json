  "observed": "Summer of 1993 time- afternoon, sunny day location- la jolla indian reservation, palomar mtns. I was walking along the creek that runs thru the campground, looking for tracks of whatever animals walked on the sandy path. I walked thru a narrow section between rocks, the creek and a steep hillside. I entered a small meadow and began walking into it. got approximately halfway into meadow when I started to get a tingling sensation on the back of my neck, as if something was watching me. I turned around and saw a large creature squatted down in the middle of the path I just walked on. The animal stood up and very quickly walked up the brushy embankment. There was no sound at all, no branches or twigs snapping, and then it was gone. I walked back to the point were I saw it squatted and it had left a single, dark brown and black stool on the path. I could not judge sex of the animal, only that it was brown, walked on two legs and was approximately six feet tall. the speed it covered the terrain and its stealth were both impressive and somewhat scary.",
