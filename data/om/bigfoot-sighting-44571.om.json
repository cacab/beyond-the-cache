  "observed": "I was sitting in a deer stand (box 12 foot high on stilts) about 0530 AM. In Randolph county, GA on my grandfather's land.  I climbed up and it was still dark out, about 30 degrees.  About 30 minutes after climbing in the stand and settling down I noticed a musty, dank smell, kind of like a wild hog that's been in a wallow, but really swampy.  It kept getting stronger and keep in mind I'm about 100 yards off a dirt road in the woods.  I saw something about 7.5 - 8' tall step out from behind a tree, swaying back and forth looking at me from either side of the tree. I reached for my gun, and when I looked back up it was gone. I didn't see any tracks when I looked after I got out, I've never hunted that stand since Thanksgiving 2011.",
