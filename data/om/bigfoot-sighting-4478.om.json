  "observed": "I was jogging down a side road with my daughter and her friend. They were on bikes. I saw what I thought was a person on the road in front of us. As we approached closer, I thought it was a person wearing a bulky coat or coveralls. About 30 yards from the creature, I realized that it wasn't a person. It's back was to us. It was looking down at the dirt road. Then it turned around and looked at us. It looked to be about 7 feet tall and weighed about 500 pounds. It had long, sparse red hair; the hair was thicker on it's back and shoulder blades. No hair was on it's face. It walked towards us.. I turned around and had the girls start riding their bikes back the way we came. I followed on foot and we never looked back.",
