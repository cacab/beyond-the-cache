  "observed": "I am 16 years of age,and it is 4:27 and about an hour ago i was mowing a friend of the familys lawn and kept noticeing these rocks being thrown at me and so i thought that the weed eater was hitting these rocks and didn't think much and it, well about two mins later i could smell this awful B.O smell and thinking i must really have bad B.O, so i checked and i couldn't smell anything and the rocks started to come back at me again but this time i could hear laughter but like a retarded person so i keep looking around to see if anyone was around messing with me, AND NOBODY WAS THERE so i just kept mowing and smelling that awful smell and then the rocks started being thrown at me and i looked over in the woods and trees and saw this huge creature behind a tree and my hair went strait up on end and i ran like a bat out of hell and when i got to the door i looked back and it was running through the trees and the trees and bushes were moving fast like in Jurassic Park and i know it wasn't a bear it was too tall and no bear can run that fast on two legs if they can run on two legs at all. it was about 8 to 9 ft. tall.    6/8/02 ",
