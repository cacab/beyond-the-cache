  "observed": "We had set up camp just before dusk and were sitting around the campfire. We tried wood knocks and call blasting. We did hear a wood knock in response to one of ours. Throughout the night we heard coyotes and owls but also 3 howls we could not identify, and 2 more wood knocks. We also heard at 2 different times in different areas close to camp what sounded like heavy sighs. At about 11pm I got up from the fire to go and relieve myself. I walked to the other side of my truck, about 25 ft from the fire and as I stood there I had a very strange feeling and then a rock came flying thru the air and landed about 10 feet from me. The next morning as we were looking around the camp we found 6 foot prints. 3 were good enough to cast and we did. We believe they are from a juvenile and were there from a day or two before and we just didn't see them while setting up camp the night before. This was in Saline County on land owned by a logging company.",
