  "observed": "The following on-site interview was conducted by Stan Courtney. The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - Jim, can you explain what happened? Jim - When I was about 16 years old, myself and two friends were parked by the woods, weren't drinking or anything, which is an important factor there. I actually saw a hand come around a tree, like you were gripping a tree, or something, but a big furry hand. And being a kid I thought it was a werewolf, the first thing I thought. And I told my buddies and they looked but didn't see it a first. Not even a moment later a big, I didn't know what it was, a big furry head stuck around the corner, peeked at us, and went right back. It didn't charge us and it didn't move. And then we took off from there like wildfire, just flew out of there. But, that is something we never really talked about because we never knew what it was. Stan - What year would this have been? Jim - That would have been in about 1974. Stan - And in summer? Jim - Yes, it would be middle of summer. It was just one of those little Forest Reserve cutoffs where you pull-in, and your car is kind of almost in the woods. Stan - How tall was it? Jim - I would have to say eight foot range. The hand was up there high, that is what caught me off-guard. Stan - And what color was it? Jim - It was a blackish-brown, I just remember seeing a big hand. You would almost mistake it for a gorilla-type thing. It is something that is not natural in Illinois. Stan - And were you able to see the face? Jim - Yeah, have you ever played peek-a-boo with the kids? You know how you do that? It was kind of like that, it stuck around the corner and went right back. I just remember it wasn't a person, eight foot tall and it was all furry, but it wasn't a gorilla face. We thought it was a werewolf, because we were all kids.",
