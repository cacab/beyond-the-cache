  "observed": "As two witnesses were hunting, they became aware of something noisily making its way through some brush about 50 yards away. Thinking it too large to be a deer, both witnesses simultaneously viewed from their tree stands a large, hairy, 7 ft. tall creature walking across an old logging trail (this only totally clear area near them) before they could do anything. The creature suddenly tore through the forest away from the hunters. (The witnesses believe that it possibly smelled them and became spooked.) It was too dark by the time the witnesses got out of their tree stands to find any footprints, but they did observe damaged undergrowth.",
