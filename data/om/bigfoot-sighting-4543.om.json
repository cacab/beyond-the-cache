  "observed": "OBSERVED: My great aunt, Ida Jones told me that when she was young (about 1905) she and her brother and sister were walking home one night from a party when they saw a thing sitting out in the field beside the road.  She said it looked like a man but was covered with dark hair.  She said she could see the moon reflected in its eyes (which implies that the eyes were set in front, not on the side like a bear's).  I made no noise but it watched them, turning it's head as the passed.  The three walked home arm in arm with one walking backward to see if the thing was following them.",
