  "observed": "I was driving home from Cedar Bluff high school on Hwy 9 towards my house. As I was coming down the road I caught a glimpse of something at the edge of the wood line. I put on my brakes to get a better view and that's when I saw what it was. It was about 7 to 8 feet tall. Dark hairy color and was standing on 2 legs. It stood and stared at me a few seconds and then turned and walked back into the woods. It took 2 strides and it was gone. I was freaked out!!!! I knew when I saw it, that it was a sasquatch. I came home and told my husband what I had saw and he could clearly tell that I was shaken up.",
