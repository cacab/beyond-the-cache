  "observed": "I heard my dogs barking and howling outside. I got my flashlight and opened my door to look out. As I was scanning the woods, my light caught two sets of eye shine. One was approx. seven to eight feet off the ground standing beside a tree. The other was around six feet off the ground standing on the other side of the tree. They were around 15 to 20 feet inside the wood line. It scared the crap out of me, every hair on my body stood on end. This sorta stuff has been going on for the past three years. My dogs start barking every night around 9:30 to 10:00 pm.",
