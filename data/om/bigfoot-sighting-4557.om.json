  "observed": "One morning in the middle of June 1997. It was early on Saturday morning my mom was on her way to work. She was driving down Williamâ€™s Road at around 7am. There wasn't much traffic on the road, but when she crossed a overpass. She saw something stooped over in the road, as she got closer it stood up . It looked at her just for a couple of seconds then walked away. It just stepped over the guardrail, and was gone. And only one week later on channel 10 news someone else seen it also. They even had a drawing of it on TV. My mom said it was the same thing she saw. This is the first  time ever she has ever saw anything strange like that. It really makes us all wonder.",
