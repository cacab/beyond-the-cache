  "observed": "A boy of 12 years of age was squirrel hunting on his parents property. His parents own over 100 acres of land which has livestock on it. At any rate, the boy, whom I'll call Mike, was sitting just inside the woodline waiting for a chance to get a squirrel. He heard something running towards him off to his right and thought it was a deer. He soon discovered it was a rabbit running through the woods. A moment later he heard some heavy walking and thought it was a person. It wasn't. What Mike saw was described as between 7 and 8 feet tall; was white in color and the skin on its hands and face was black. Mike noted the fact that the fingers on the hands were long and skinny. The creature rested one of its hands on the side of a tree. He didn't see the eyes but that could have been because of bangs hanging over them. He only saw part of the ears. He did see that the head was not rounded like human, but sloped back to a point. He also said it was \"fat\". I finally learned what he meant by fat. It was very bulky from the waist up. Mike saw all of the creature except below the shins. After about 30 seconds the creature noticed Mike. They had a brief stare down and Mike finally gave in by running out of the woods, through an open field and back to the house. As it turns out, Mike was about 35 feet from this creature. This report is discussed in depth in the November 1998 issue of my newsletter the Monthly Bigfoot Report, #75.",
