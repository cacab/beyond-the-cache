  "observed": "I was camping at Jones Creek at exactly the 4 mile marker on July 7, 2014. The woods were very quiet and only one guy on a 4 wheeler came past me and then again leaving much earlier that day. Just at dusk I heard a yell like no other animal I have ever heard about a quarter mile south. It lasted about 10 seconds. A minute or two later it happened again only louder. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. About 5 minutes later another yell comes about a quarter mile north of me only this time its 3 times louder. It yelled 5 separate times with about 10 seconds between each 10 second long yell. These yells were much stronger of a voice than the first two yells. About 2 minutes later the first yeller did it again only it sounded like it was further south. I don't believe a human could be as loud as this was at a distance and the voice was far too big. I was scared to death and spent the night with my gun in my hand laying frozen in my completely dark tent trailer. I was afraid to turn any lights on just pretended to be asleep. At 4:30 am the first log truck went by  followed by several others so I felt safe again.",
