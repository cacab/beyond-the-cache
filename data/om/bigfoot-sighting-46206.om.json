  "observed": "This evening at approximately 6:15 PM in Rockingham County Virginia, my friend and I were out on a hike in the George Washington National Forest, a few miles off Rt. 33 close to the WV border. Upon being out for several hours we stopped to rest and eat. We rested for 20 minutes or so when we stood up and turned around we could see down the mountain side. Something was standing there. We could see two legs and what looked like a hand and possibly a head. It looked like a brownish red color and even though we were so high up we could still see it was huge. When we both pulled out our phones to try and get a picture it walked off and that was the last we saw of it. If it was a bear it was not like any bear I have ever seen. I have no clue what it was.  We observed it for up to a minute and a half.",
