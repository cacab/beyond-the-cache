  "observed": "My wife and I took an early evening stroll on private land by our residence. We arrived at a campsite about 7:15pm and as we were sitting on a picnic table, we looked out over a small pond and noticed a leaf on a tree fluttering very fast, as if someone was intentionally doing it. There was absolutely no wind at all. To the right of this leaf was a very large black mass moving back and forth methodically. It was between a couple of medium size trees, blocking out the background behind it. The sun was hitting the exact spot, and you could clearly see a large black mass of at least 7 feet tall, and 4 feet wide just swaying back and forth...we both witnessed this from about 30 yards or less, and my wife said the face looked like a gorillas...all I could focus on was the immense size of the body...this is not the first time we had encountered something. I filed a report back in 2013 which yielded a call from the BFRO.",
