  "observed": "Bigfoot sighting. Late March or early April, 2009.  Approximately 1815 hours. I was southbound on GA75 between Helen and Cleveland, GA about .2 of a mile north of Duncan Bridge, (Hwy 384). As I rounded a bend I saw something getting ready to cross the road from east to west. As I slowed my first thought was that someone was dressed in a costume, but I dismissed that idea because every pickup around here had a shotgun in the back window and a good percentage, like myself, had a gun in the car. When he heard me he stopped on the shoulder. He did not look at me for a few seconds, but then slowly he turned toward me, looked, then continued to turn 180 degrees and walk into the woods. I was unable to pull off to the shoulder and park because of hay bales and plastic used to stop erosion.  Traffic was backing up behind me so I drove to Duncan Bridge then left on a private road, with the hope of seeing him again. No luck. What I saw. He appeared to be 6 foot 2 to 6 foot 4. He was standing erect but had a slightly hollow chest. His legs and torso seemed normal (as compared to a human) but his arms were longer. His fur was full and sleek. It had a shine to it. A medium to light brown. He looked healthy. It was his eyes that I remember most. He looked at me with an  intelligence that you don't see in an animal. The only other time I experienced that was with a dolphin. I contacted DNR the next day. They had not received other sightings. I know the lady that submitted your . I called her and we compared notes. Even though the two sightings were only .2 miles apart, seems like a different animal.",
