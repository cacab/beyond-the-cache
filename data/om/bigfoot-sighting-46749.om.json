  "observed": "Where I work, they let us hunt and fish on the grounds. The last few years I have been hunting the west side of the property and every early Fall they or it is there. A few years ago, I had one violently shake a tree and run off just out of sight. Then, last year one let out not a scream and not a howl but a cross between the two so loud and close that I could feel it in my chest. I got to tell you it scared me half to death about a half hour before dark. I waited a little bit because I didn't know if it knew I was there or not and then I left. About a month ago I was doing a little scouting before deer season and heard some whoops and on Oct.9th I had, only what I can compare it to, is either 3 large rocks slammed on the ground or something stomped the ground hard enough to feel it in my feet three times and just far enough out of my view that I could not see it. I spoke out but got no reply. Nothing ran away or moved in the woods. I took it as a warning that I am here, go back, and that's what I did. I have hunted all my life and I know what a deer sounds like when it stomps its hoof, it was not that. I got to tell you, I have never been uncomfortable in the woods but this is getting kinda spooky.",
