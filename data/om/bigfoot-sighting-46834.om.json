  "observed": "In the month of June 2008 I was camping with my partner and her sister at Beaver Creek State Park, Columbiana County, Ohio. I had camped and hiked in that park since I was a little kid, and felt comfortable there and knew the woods, trails, area well. We had been camping for 2 days, and were on our second evening. We had a campsite in the \"pines\" side of the campgrounds. In the evening, around 8:30, I went a ways into the woods behind our site to \"answer the call of nature\" so to speak. While I was going number one I heard a loud crash, it startled me as I thought it sounded like a deer crashing off. I jumped up, and saw a dark very muscular figure hurrying off quickly in the direction diagonal to our site and our camping neighbor. It was very dark, with bulging deltoid muscles. I could not get in my head what the heck was happening, as it was human form but appeared like it had no clothes on, plus black. The figure moved quickly, without reaching up to brush branches away like most people would do going thru the woods. It headed back toward where there's nothing but a steep drop off ravine. I told my girlfriend and her sister, both were scared and wanted to leave. I insisted on staying as I was so fascinated at what I thought I saw. We spent a restless night and got rained out the next morning, quickly waking up before dawn. We haven't camped there since. I now live in Powell, north of Columbus and have only camped at A.W. Marion State Park. Never had an experience like this.",
