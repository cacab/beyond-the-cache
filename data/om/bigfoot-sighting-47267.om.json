  "observed": "First off, I live in Rooks county and I always take county roads to Hays because it is so much quicker than taking the highway. One evening after grocery shopping with my wife and brother in Hays, we were on our way home, on the 10 road about two and a quarter miles North of the county line road. My wife couldn't take her eyes off of two red eyes staring at us through some trees off to the West of the road. My brother and I both saw something that could had been either white or light grey walking perpendicular across the road with taking only two steps. After we encountered this, I stopped my vehicle, in the road to only our surprise, on the East side of the road were another set of red eyes looking right at us. The problem is, the eyes we saw were at least 8 to 9 feet off the ground. We don't have bears out here, so we know for certain it could had been no way shape or form a bear.",
