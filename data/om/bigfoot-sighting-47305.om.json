  "observed": "Two weekends ago, I was crossbow hunting for deer down the end of Twin Bridges Rd. With it being the last day for gun season, I decided to go much further than I've gone into the woods, mainly to get away from the main parking area. I started down the equine trail towards the south. I walked a good forty five minutes before deciding I was good and far away from the \"Bang bangers\", and not likely to get hit with a deerslug. As usual, I hunted til I could not see twenty yards, and started to get my gear together. I heard a couple loud cool owl hoots by the time I had my gear stowed, when I heard a howl that made me stop and compare to things I've heard in the past. The only description that comes to mind is the howl done by the lady on Bigfoot Hunter, the name escapes me at the moment. Logical thinking told myself it was probably a coyote, but for grins, I picked up a short solid branch and gave the nearest tree a couple good whacks. I listened for a couple minutes, and not hearing anything, I loaded my ghost blind and pack onto my back, picked up my crossbow and started my long walk back to the parking area. I was walking for less than five minutes when from in the distance behind me, came two loud knocks, followed by a long drawn out \"Yip\". Needless to say, I wasted no time getting back to my truck. Twin Bridges Rd is off route 133, south of Williamsburg.",
