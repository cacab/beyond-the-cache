I was on the side of the road facing north in my rear view mirror I seen a tall black figure walk behind my vehicle it crossed the road in 3 strides. I thought it was a early morning person out for a walk. As time went by I noticed the walking trail was in front of me not behind me.  Behind me was all guard rail and a steep drop off which later I tried to walk but found most impossible.",
