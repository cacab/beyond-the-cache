  "observed": "About 8pm. a couple of nights ago, I was working in my garage and something big brushed up against the outside garage door. It was really loud and got my attention. I went upstairs and made sure no one was outside causing the noise. That night about 330am. my girl friend told me she heard a storage box in the back of my pickup truck being opened and moved around. I got up, went to see. I didn't see anything around the truck, but did see reflections of three sets of eyes just in front of the house about 50'. Two sets of eye reflections were lower, one set around 4' tall, the other about 6' tall.  The third set of eyes stood at least 8' tall or higher. I did this because there was a tree next to them and some branches were present during the observation. I observed the reflections for about an hour. The next morning my girl friend and I walked out into the yard. We could see that something disturbed the dew that was on the grass. She found two huge tracks that appeared to be barefoot.",
