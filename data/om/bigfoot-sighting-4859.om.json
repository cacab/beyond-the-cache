  "observed": "I was horseback riding about 3 miles from our house near the green river gorge.There is a mine shaft that is covered with a grate that you can stand on. After checking the grate out for a while I rode on a ways until I came to a clearing that allowed me to see across the green river to an area that had been clearcut about 1 month earlier. I noticed at once that there was a \"man\" watching me from about halfway up the hill side. I thought to myself \"geez, that guy is huge\" then it began to walk up the hillside with these huge strides and effotlessly stepping over logs and swinging its' arms with a most peculular motion. Its' color was a brownish grey. I thought to myself, It's a sasquatch! I watched it for about 2 minutes as it worked its' way up the hill and into the tree line. The next day I went riding there again with my father and we saw it in the same spot watching us again from across the river, then it walked its' way up the hill and back into the woods.",
