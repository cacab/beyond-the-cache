  "observed": "This is being typed by the investigator as told by the hunter. \"I was turkey hunting on April 5, 2015 and I cut across a field of sawgrass and found what appeared to be a mound of dead sawgrass piled high which did not occur naturally. It was obvious it has been pulled up by hand and was some sort of a bed or nest. I've never seen anything like it. To my knowledge there isn't any animal that can do this.\" \"It was larger than the bed in my pickup truck.\" \"When I got home, I told my nephew about it. He asked me to go back and take a photo of it. The next weekend, I did. He contacted the BFRO for me.\"",
