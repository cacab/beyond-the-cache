  "observed": "My son and I are fans of the show \"Finding Bigfoot\". He is 11 and I'm 43 years of age, he's a believer and I am not. It is an interesting topic but I'm a see it to believe it type of guy. We just got back from a 3 day Memorial Day weekend in Tonasket Washington. A friend has property there and invited us out. I thought for the fun of it I would take the boys (4 of them) ages 11, 13, 15 and 18 out to a dark and scary place to have fun and do some so called \"knocks\" and \"squatch\" calls... Well let me tell you my friends what ever it was either animals or what might ya... It is very active out there and the sounds scared the crap out of me...... We didn't see anything at all but we all heard many things loud and clear! I'm not easily scared I'm 6ft 6 inches and 255 lbs... And I was carrying my 9mm with me.. But this got my attention. Just thought I would drop a line on what we heard might interest you guys. We heard back on \"knocks\" , \"squatch\" calls (adult and young) and even heard a tree breaking.  This may be all animals but I'm no expert but I'm starting to believe... R.",
