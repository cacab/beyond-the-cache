  "observed": "I have been hearing these howls for 6-7 years now possibly more. At first I thought it was a person. But as I heard it more I realized its not. Hear it mostly at night after dark , but occasionally during daylight hours. Live not too far from metro airport. Sometimes planes are louder and seem lower than other times. I have noted  howls are much increased with heavy plane traffic. Also seem more active on very hot humid nights. I have heard what appears to be more than one howling together. But then the coyote all get howling and its hard to tell. It usually goes like this, apx 1am I will hear several howls like you hear on recording.  This gets all the dogs around here barking. Then barking dies down and another howl....dogs barking...and on and on.continues all night increasing just before daybreak. Then quiet mostly with light of day. I have heard this deep humanish howl alone mostly. And all the years I have been hearing it its the same voice/howl. A few times I heard it with a similar howl but higher pitched. Occasionally I hear it with coyote. Hard to tell if its howling with coyote. Or if coyote just howl because they hear it. It's always its howl first and usually before it stops the coyote start their yips n howls. It usually follows a pattern of movement. Comes in from west travels east, hangs out a long time just east of our house  then continues on past our house until I cannot hear it , then comes back heading west again passing our house. I know this because I wait till its howls have diminished off to east before I go outside to the barn or what ever I need to do out there after dark. I have been out in back a distance from house and heard it howl and it sounding like its only feet away. Incredibly loud. And unnerving. But not nearly as unnerving as it is now (then I thought it was possibly a wolf) now that you think it may be a saqsuach. Well that explains a few things. They say there are no wolves in this area, but I have actually seen a wolf pack chasing deer out of the woods. Happened last fall right across the road. I think the wolves follow the migrating deer herds. In the winter everything gets quiet. Even with last years mild winter. Have not heard howl since around last Christmas. (2012) I recorded it because I was not  sure what it was. I have heard coyote, wolves and dogs howl but this was different. Must have massive lung capacity to be able to sustain a loud and yodeling howl for as long as it does. Not sure how to feel about this.  I think it may have been sleeping in my barn on a few occasions.",
