  "observed": "A neighbor's chicken coop was raided. I keep birds also so I was curious how I may reinforce my cage to avoid the same situation.  I investigated. What struck me immediatly was the strength necessary to \"bend and compress\" the wire used in my neighbor's coop.  There is no way with my bare hands could I bend and compress the wire of this guage.  I collected hair samples. No cat could have done this.  A bear would have taken a much more destructive entry.",
