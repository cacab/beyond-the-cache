  "observed": "Hi my name is XXXXXXX XXXX . I live in Nottingham, NH. Here is my story. So I was riding my bicycle in the woods when I heard a loud howl. When I heard that howl it felt like lightning struck me. I looked to the right and at the bottom of a hill in the woods I saw a big brown figure hitting a tree. I pedaled as fast as I could and ran inside. I would like to speak to a researcher personally. I give permission to have my story put on the website.",
