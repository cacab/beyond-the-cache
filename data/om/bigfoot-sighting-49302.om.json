  "observed": "My mother and I were traveling between New Douglas and Livingston on New Douglas Rd heading west to Livingston. It was dark and in the headlights we both saw it run from the left side of the road to the right side of the road in front of the car. The road had steep banks on both sides and it ran down and across the road and out of sight on the other side of the road very quickly. It went from being on all fours to two legs as it was crossing the road. It was big, brown, hairy and very fast. My mother and I both looked at each other and said \"did you see that\" at the same time. We were scared to turn around but did go back with two other people within about 30 min of the sighting but we didn't see anything else. After we saw this my mom told me that when she was a kid living in New Douglas that there were stories of a \"Crazy Guy\" that lived in the woods in this same area. I can tell you 100% that this wasn't a person or any other animal that I have ever seen.",
