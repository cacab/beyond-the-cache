  "observed": "It was Saturday, 9/14/02, at around 11:15AM while fishing on Riffe Lake.  I had my son and a friend of his in the boat with me.  We had pulled up to a point and shut down to start fishing when I scanned the clearcut like I always do looking for deer or elk.  About 150 yards off of the shore, I noticed something walking.  My first thought was \"it sure is awful warm to be bundled up like that\" and then immediately thought \"your coat sleeves are really long\".  I then said to the boys, \"hey look, a sasquatch\".  They both spotted it and it was walking away from us at a 45* angle looking back over its left shoulder.  It went behind a big stump and we didn't see it for several seconds.  It came out from the other side and stood facing us and just looked at us for probably 30 seconds.  At this point we all got serious because we could tell that it didn't appear to be a human and I know it was not a bear.  It turned and started walking away from us looking back ever so often.  It stopped just before going down a little raven and stood looking at us again.  It went down in the ravene and up the other side then disappeared into the timber.  The boys were very \"excited & nervous\" by now.  We discussed this amongst ourselves and I guess we watched this thing for close to 5 minutes.  I am originally from Arkansas, just a farm boy who has hunted and fished all of my life.  I have heard people talk about these things for years and haven't given them much thought one way or another.  What we saw definetly was not human, it was hairy from head to toe and was large, I don't know how tall.  It walked with long strides and it's arms & hand swung in an long swings as it walked.  At approximately 150 yards, coupled with the amount of time it was in sight, we had a pretty good look.  We are going back to the lake this Saturday and I am going to get out and look around.  This time I'm taking binoculars and a camcorder.  I'm not one to get caught up in myths, but what we saw wasn't ordinary.",
