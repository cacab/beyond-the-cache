  "observed": "My 20 yr daughter was driving. I was in the passenger side..going south towards town on Irvine Ave. it was close to xmas..a yr and a half ago. was around 8pm. a huge..fast upright thing ran in view of our headlights..and in front of the oncoming car headlights. I saw from the waist up and arms pumping. whatever I saw took only 2 to 2 and a half strides to clear shoulder to shoulder. I saw it on the right shoulder.went ahhh..an involuntary reaction by the time I finished, it was gone. I asked my daughter if she saw that..she said she saw something..but thought it was a whirlwind. I told her what I saw. We wanted to go back the next day to see is we could see anything unusual but it was like 30 below and didn't.",
