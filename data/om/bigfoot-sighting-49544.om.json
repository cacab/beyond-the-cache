  "observed": "My wife and I were fishing in the Ohoopee river in a Jon boat when we heard something come running thru the woods towards us. Tree branches and bushes were being snapped off. It stopped short of the edge of the creek and was behind the bushes standing about 7-8 feet tall. We saw the top of its head which was a reddish brown with hair covering its facial features. It made no noise as it stood there watching us. We quickly paddled to the opposite shore where our campsite was set up. The creature paced back and forth along the bank, but just behind the bushes. We could plainly hear each step and each limb being broken as well as getting glimpses of it thru the brush. It stayed until late pm, early a.m. when we heard a loud splash into the river. We heard it scramble back up the bank and run thru the woods away from us. It sounded like a horse running thru the woods (noise from the breaking of limbs and heavy foot steps pounding the ground). Next am we saw where it had clawed its way back up the bank, leaving impressions from hands and fingers, not hoof marks like a deer or hog would leave. We had no camera to take photos.",
