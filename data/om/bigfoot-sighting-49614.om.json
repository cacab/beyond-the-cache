  "observed": "Our trail cam took a picture of something with long hair. Whatever it was stood right up in front of the lens, so you can't see a body shot, but the picture shows brownish-reddish hair hanging down in front of the camera. There were a few large tracks - barefoot - the toes were clearly visible. We took pictures of the tracks with a tape measure alongside them.",
