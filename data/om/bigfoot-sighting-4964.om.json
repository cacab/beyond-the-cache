  "observed": "We were setting up a burn barrel out by the woods.  We thought that the wind had blown it over but it was one third full so it could not have been the wind. Barrel would not sit straight so I was walking across the yard to get a piece of pipe to sit under it to hold it up. Half way across the yard I heard brush, breaking when I looked over,we saw a large hairy creature very tall staring at us. I let out a holler  and it turned and walked away slowly in a large stride swinging its arms almost like a person but definitely was not. Looked about seven foot tall.",
