  "observed": "On September 9, 2015, I was driving down 43 (W) outside of Bedford, Virginia at 11:38PM when I saw to the right side of the road, walking away from the road, a Bigfoot with child.  It was next to the mail box for 4472 on 43, where there is a gravel poured drive.  At first I thought it was a deer, about same coloring, but as I got closer I noticed it was not a deer at all, it was much taller, about 6 ft., from the hips down. As I got closer it appeared the Mom (I assume that since there was a baby with it) put the baby down and was bending over for rocks?  At that time the baby looked right at me and it looked just like the Wukie (?, the furry, hairy creature) on Star Wars and it had a brown looking nose.  The baby seemed as surprised to see me as I was them, I guess WE look like aliens to them.  The baby was about 3 ft., it hit the mom at mid thigh.  I painted circles around the footprints I found the next day, 3 prints, with about a 36‚Äù stride.  The first print you come upon is the best, prints are difficult to produce in gravel, but the first one is in fine gravel.  There are two circles next to each other where it appeared the mom put the baby down.  They were headed into the woods and although there are deer around, there was a path worn in that direction. I reported this to the local Police dept and it was ignored, basically, they did not bother to even look at the prints.  The guy who took my report said, \"In ten years, I have never heard of such around these parts.\"",
