  "observed": "While driving home one evening approx. 2100, while passing near Tiger Creek, I witnessed something standing on the side of the road.  I was tall approx. 7 to 8 feet, it was standing in front of a road sign as a reference, initially I believed it was a bear on its hind legs, however as I got closer it turned and walked towards the woods.  The Creature was dark in color covered in hair and walked upright.  It turned away as the headlights from my truck hit it, the creature walked into an area that was heavily wooded with dense underbrush.  The creature did not seem to be bothered or concerned with the automobile.",
