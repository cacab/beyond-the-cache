  "observed": "I would like to talk to you guys because a lot of other stuff has been occurring around my farm. A few months ago something screamed at me and then went who \"who\" like an owl. I looked up the scream on the web and the thing it sounded most like was a cougar, but the owl sound was not an owl. Other things that happens is rocks being thrown when I'm in garden, or at night when I get home and sit on back porch. Once when I was cutting fire wood at dusk and was loading wood something or someone threw a lot of rocks and made a ruckus. Also at night when I get home I sit on back porch to play with my dogs something hits the side of an old outhouse along with the rock throwing and screams. This happens most nights of the week. I've never seen anything but the day after the scream and owl call I went to where it sounded like it came from and found one track in an old rotten log. It looked like a person was barefoot and the track was the ball of the foot and the toes was showing but rain washed some of it away. Also this weekend I went to check out my treestands and beside one was a tree with big branches piled around it in a way that doesn't look natural to me. Like I said I live on a 200 acre farm and my closest neighbor is a mile away. and I hear stuff and things get tossed off of hillsides night and day.",
