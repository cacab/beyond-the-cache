  "observed": "On Nov. 24th 2015 I was hunting deer during FIREARM season back on the hill behind my house...I am going \"bonkers\" for lack of a better word, trying to process what I saw that day. I was walking up an old dirt road, the ground was wet, leaves etc. so I was very quiet. I reached an area where I was looking down into the forest , I raised up my binoculars because I, at that moment, was expecting to see a smaller black bear...as I was looking at its back I noticed a very thin white hair line running down the middle of its back...I thought that's a strange marking for a black bear...I continued watching this \"creature\" for quite a few minutes...I wanted to see its face...slowly it turned its head and as if it were looking into my eyes through the binoculars. Its face was solid black of the blackest night, very shiny, looked almost like black leather stretched tight, its nose was very wide and had huge nostrils, it seemed to be hunkered down by an old fallen tree and it was in the sunshine that was beaming through parts the forest, it had no hair on its face..everything was black ..its face looked human, I could see ears like mine only black its hair on its body was a lighter black than its face and somewhat thin (compared to a black bear's) and it wasn't dirty or mangled, it looked clean. In the mean time as I was steadily watching it, small sandstone rocks were coming down by me from the road above I didn't want to turn and look, I was watching the creature below me and figured it was chipmunks running around behind me causing small rocks to fall but after seeing that face I had to look...I saw nothing behind me...when I returned to using the binoculars and looking for it ...It was gone... no sound what-so-ever. I now feel that something behind me was trying to get my attention so it could get away. Someone said that it was probably a man in one of those strange looking suits to hunt in...my reply was \"he needs to get mental help immediately for the fact that everyone on this mountain this week are carrying high powered rifles\". (I never once felt scared or threatened, all was calm) I saw no limbs arms legs.. I was focused on its head... It wasn't huge like the width of it...as I stated before from behind looked like a small bear (except it had a human like face)... I would appreciate any feed back. (forgot to mention that in October and part of November during bow season I heard some very strange sounds during 3 of my hunting days up there...I call them \"jungle sounds\" ooh ooh ooh aah aah aah woooo repeated at a fast pace)",
