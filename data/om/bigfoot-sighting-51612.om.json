  "timestamp": 1434499200,
  "observed": "Myself, my wife, and 4 children were on our way back home from church on rural dirt road, Old Joy Shannon Road. At the edge of my headlights something appeared on the side of the road. I slammed on my brakes, and before we stopped it, he'd crossed the road. It had taken one step onto the middle of the road and the next was on the other side. Then it went over a barb wire fence with a step. We sat there trying to make sense of what we had just seen and the only thing we could think of is sasquatch. This has changed our whole outlook on what might be out there.",
