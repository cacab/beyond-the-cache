  "observed": "Me and two other friends were up exploring this logging road near North Bend. We have herd about some weird things and encounters up there so we decided that we were gonna go see what was out there. I can't say I was expecting anything to happen but I was open to the idea of it. As we were driving up, we pulled off and were walking around on a game trail. I located an interesting footprint. I was able to make out toes on the print but I was unable to determine any other features since the print looks a few weeks old but still got a picture (which I still have). So we continued on. We found a road that was washed out so we went on foot about 2 miles in. We first went about half a mile in when all of a sudden a rock was thrown over our heads and landed in front of me. We thought it was very strange and a little creepy. We had some guns which in a way comforted us that we had some sort of protection. So we decided to keep moving. As we walked down this road, we kept hearing movement along the way. We had the feeling that we were being watched. Eventually it started to get dark so we start back to the truck and as we turned around another rock was thrown from behind, landing in front of us. We were very worried and my friend shot 3 warning shots into the air. We started speed walking back and continued to hear movement in the trees. We got back to the truck and got out of there. When we got almost back to pavement, we pulled off and just relaxed. It was night by this time and we were all in the truck. After a few minutes we started hearing movement again in the bushes. We stayed aware but didn't overreact like before. After about 6 minutes, something hit the truck. We flipped on out light bar and got out to see what it was. There was nothing around the truck that could've hit it except for a nearby stick. My friend threw the stick back in the woods and we all got back in the truck. It was about 5 minutes later in the same location when something hit the truck again. Like before we turned the light on and got out. We looked around for the object and it turned out to be the exact same stick. This is when things got weird because he threw the stick back in the woods and got back inside. Then it happened again and as we're outside, we threw the same stick back and we were still looking around as we continued to hear movement. Then as we were still outside, I saw the same stick fly out of nearby bushes and hit the hood of the truck. That's when we knew that we had to leave. This had all of us very upset and honestly frightened for our lives. At first I was open to the idea of a \"Bigfoot\" but after this night, I was convinced. I have since gone back up and have had other experiences but not as severe. Id be willing to show an expert.",
