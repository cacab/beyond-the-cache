  "observed": "I saw a Sasquatch face to face at 24 ft. The details were shocking. It was large and hair covered, looking at me and I was frozen in place. It was behind a small rise in the ground making only mid chest to the top of its head visible. The hair was reddish brown color and was short from the top of the head getting longer down its body. The short hair on the body was thinner and around five inches long. The arm hair was much longer at eighteen inches. The face was hair covered like a mans beard and lighter in color.. The Sasquatch had the same look that I had, a surprised look. Eyes were opened wide and mouth. I seen no teeth. The head was not cone shaped. Eyes were brown and looking me up and down. The right arm was stuck out to the side with a bend. I didn't see ears.",
