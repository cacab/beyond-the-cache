  "observed": "My wife and I were on a Sunday drive on our Honda Goldwing Motorcycle heading South on the Chazy Lake Road towards Saranac, New York.  We live in Cadyville NY which is about 4 miles east of Saranac.  The Chazy Lake Road is a not too often traveled road in a heavilly wooded area.  I was comenting to my wife how quite our motorcycle was and I pulled the clutch lever in to allow the motorcycle to coast.  As we rounded the next curve we both saw 2 large black hairy figures in the middle of the road facing each other.  They looked into our direction then immediately ran into the woods.  They both headed into the woods in opposite directions.  The ran quite fast slightly bent at the waist.  When we arrived at the point where we saw them, there was no sign of them.  When this happened, my wife said, did you see what I think I just saw?  I said yes.  We agreed we would not tell anyone of our experience for fear of redicule.  I would estimate their size to be at least 6 feet tall and at least 200 plus pounds.",
