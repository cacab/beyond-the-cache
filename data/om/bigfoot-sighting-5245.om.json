  "observed": " May 1983, Kinderhook, NY (Columbia County) 5:30 - 6:00 pm. At the corner of Rt. 203 and State Farm Rd. My daughter and I were making a right hand turn at the cow pasture of Rt 203 and State Farm Rd. in Valatie when we saw a large (7 feet at least), hairy man-like creature.  He was getting up from what appeared to be from a crouching position to a standing position.  I stopped the car suddenly. It glanced our way and then took off in the oppositite direction through the cow pasture.  The entire incident took less than 5 minutes. The creature's hair color was light brown.  The hair covered his face except for his eyes and mouth. Joyce Gifford 2 Spruce Run E. Greenbush, NY 12061",
