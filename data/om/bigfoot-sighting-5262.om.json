  "observed": "Late in the evening I was pulling my car around the apartment complex when I saw what I thought was a bear. The next day after seeing the tracks near the garbage dumpster area I was convinced it was a Bigfoot. I called the police to show them the footprints and the police laughed at me. I took pictures of them because we had a light snow fall the day before. My father who was from the West Virginia Mountains and knows animal tracks said the tracks couldn't be a bears because of the way the prints were deeper in front and so far apart. As long as eight feet apart he said. At one point my father said it looked like it was reaching for something. The police said that years ago there was a bear in the area, but what I saw the night before and what we saw the next morning was not anything close to a bear. But I will say I felt at peace when I saw him the night before. I wasn't frightened at all. Its face wasn't scary, it was more like a lost and lonely puppy. For years many people in the apartment building and police department made fun of me. But I know what I saw and for being the biggest cowered around I honestly wasn't scared.",
