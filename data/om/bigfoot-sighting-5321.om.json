  "observed": "Ok, I Have decided to tell you my story after much thought. I do not want any media involved please.  My wife and I purchased our home near Kingston, Michigan in Febuary of 1999.  We were having coffee in the morning on a weekend, date I cannot recall but it was shortly after, still in February.  As we were having our coffee I was looking off into the woods behind our home and saw a tall pitch black \"ape\" walking from south to the north.  It was erect, however slightly leaning forward, not straight up.  It's arms were long and just kinda swinging loosely as it passed.  It traveled about twenty feet in my view.  I saw only it's right side.  My wife did not see it and it is really hard for her to take me serious.  I don't blame her though.  There was some snow on the ground but very scant.  No foot prints.  Ground was frozen.  I was going to investigate packing my 9mm but took something with more power because this thing was huge.",
