  "observed": "I would be happy to send you a copy of a colored picture I drew when I was 5 years old back in 1943 of what possibly could have been a bigfoot.  I was lost out in the woods while camping with my parents somewhere in central Ohio and this large female ape-like creature put me back in our camp. Then I started screaming and my parents who were out looking for me heard me and came back to the camp and found me.  I have not showed this picture to many people because they would have thought I was crazy.  I was a lawyer here in Summit County for nearly 40 years and I did not need any aspersions cast upon my sanity.  I have had two cancer surgeries in the past six months and I would now like to leave the original of this picture as a bequest in my will to the right kind of museum before anything else happens to me.  I also hope that this picture might corroborate the testimony of people with similar experiences whom nobody would believe before.  If you don't have the time to look at it, please let me know the address where the picture can be sent by parcel post or UPS.  I am grateful to that blessed creature for my life and would like to honor her memory in some way.",
