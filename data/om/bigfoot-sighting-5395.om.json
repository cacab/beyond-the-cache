  "observed": "I think I have had 3 encounters, I KNOW I have had 1, all within a 5 mile radius. the last one is the one I will tell about. I had just gotten out of my tree stand ( hunting deer ). the sun was down but still enough light to see. My house was only 1/2 mile away and the woods were my back yard. Anyway, I was using the bathroom on a tree, not really paying attention to anything. when I noticed their was no noise, nothing, no owls, no coyote, nothing. I was feeling uneasy and cut the job short, I just wanted to get out of there. I walked around a deadfall and about 40 to 50 feet from me it stood right in my path, on the trail,(footpath). at 1st I dont think he knew I was there. He stood with his head up sniffing the air. then He looked right at me. never moving for what seemed like hours. I had a 12 guage in my hand and remember thinking about using it. but something didnt feel right about that. I really didnt feel threatned. I know at some point I started to walk backwards, He took a couple of steps toward me, and cut into the woods on the otherside of the deadfall,( not the side I came around). I stood there listening to it go threw the woods not crashing but just like he was walking like it was no big deal. I asked the owner of the property the next day if he had ever seen or heard of anything back there, he said no so I never mentioned it to ANYONE. I found your site a few weeks ago and have been wondering if I should tell this or not. anyway. I know what I saw and noone can tell me diff.",
