  "observed": "There were three of us hiking through the rock creek area of the Ansel Adams Wilderness.  Michael discovered the tracks and brought them to our attention.  The tracks were heading in a northern direction across this large meadow.  The tracks were eighteen and one half inches long and had a width of eight inches.  Some of the tracks were up to three inches deep.  The stride varied from four feet to six feet in length.  There were over twelve tracks that were idenafiable.  Then to our surprise we found a broken branch next to one of the footprints that had three hair samples clinging to the bark.  We have no results from the hair samples because we lost two of the hairs and we only have one in our posession at this time.",
