  "observed": "IT WAS NOV 2002 DEER SEASON IN PHILLIPS WISC,  I WAS WALKING THE ROAD AND LOOKING FOR DEER, AS I LOOKED DOWN THE ROAD THERE WAS A LARGE BLACKISH BROWN OBJECT WALKING UPRIGHT COMING DOWN THE ROAD TOWARDS ME, SINCE WE HAVE A LOT OF BLACKBEAR IN THE AREA THATS WHAT I FIRST THOUGHT OF IT BEING, BUT WHEN I BROUGHT UP THE SCOPE TO GET A BETTER LOOK,  IT WAS NO BEAR IT WAS LIKE A MAN.  IT STOPPED AS SOON AS I MOVED INTO A CROUCHED POSITION TO STEADY MY VIEW.   I KNOW BLACKBEAR.    BEAR DO NOT WALK UPRIGHT FOR LONG DISTANCE THEY WILL STAND TO GET A BETTER LOOK BUT WHEN THEY RUN OFF THEY WILL DROP ON ALL 4 AND RUN. THIS THING RAN OFF TO THE RIGHT INTO THE ALDER SWAMP ON 2 LEGS HUNCHED OVER LIKE A MAN SLUGGED IN THE GUTS.   IT WAS NO BEAR. I WENT TO THE AREA AND LOOKED FOR TRACKS BUT ONLY FOUND THE AREA OF MOSS THAT WAS DISTURBED FROM THE THING STEPPING THROUGH THE  WATER.  IT GAVE ME A STRANGE FEELING THAT IT WAS WATCHING ME AS I STOOD THERE LOOKING INTO THE ALDERS. I AM A PRO OUTDOOR WOODSMAN AND I SEEN WHAT I SEEN. AND AT 200 YARDS WITH A 3X9X40MM SCOPE IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO ME IT WAS NOT MAN OR BEAR.",
