North of the road.. actually it looked like it was climbing up a tree or coming down a tree... did NOT know what I saw...but as soon as possible I pulled over and turned around and went back and it was gone..so I went home and drew a sketch of it...and forgot about it...I did not have internet then...when the Bigfoot programs started I watched them and that is when I knew what I had seen... actually it was difficult to draw..I couldn't get the head right and it seem to not have a neck..I think the head was kind of pointed?  not round..",
