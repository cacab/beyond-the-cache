  "observed": "While on vacation with my wife in northern NH/ME area called Lake Aziscohos. we decided to go moose antler hunting to find some dropped racks. while heading into a clearing we started following moose tracks, we went further past the clearing and came to a small water run-off ditch. Well in this small ditch we saw a very unusual track for anywhere in the northeast, a five toe'd track that was HUGE!!! I took pictures, I did not have casting material, but i do have pictures with an altoids box for size comparison, we estimated this track to be between 20-22\" long and I'd say about 8-10\" wide. this was NOT, I repeat NOT like any other tracks we have seen, the track had no claw marks, I've been an avid watcher of Finding Bigfoot and do wood knocks regularly along with screams. My wife WAS NOT a believer,but after this print, she looked at me and said \"NOW I BELIEVE YOU\" this is 100% true, I took pictures of the print!!!",
