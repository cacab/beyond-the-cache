  "observed": "On July 21st this year I was cutting grass at my Nephew's place on the Glady road. At around 8:30 I heard a Bigfoot start yelling from the nearby point. I know what they sound like for I have seen one when I was around 12 years-old and three in the past few years. They call me Daniel Boone because I spend a lot of time in the woods. And I have heard them a lot of times. On 9/11/16 I was at the old farm that was once our Grandfathers, my nephew owns it now. I have a few trout in an old spring barrel at one of the springs. On 9/11/16 I went to feed the trout, but when I got there the cows were already there drinking. I looked down and in the soft mud was two fresh tracks. I ran the cows away and got my plaster paris out of the car. I made a cast of the right print, the left one set at an angle, the plaster would have run out of the track. So I got the right one, it turned out ok.",
