  "observed": "Bigfoot in Farmdale park E. Peoria Illinois. I was about 13 years old. I'm 72 now. Snow on the ground I was carrying a gun in the woods hunting for birds, rabbits anything just killing time. I came over a hill at the creek and saw a black hairy figure about 8 feet tall walking around a round hut built with sticks and branches in the middle of a blackberry patch. I had never heard of Bigfoot at that time but I'm sure it was him now. He didn't see me at first, I watched him picking berries terrified wondering what should I do. Then he saw me, looked straight at me and just disappeared! I was gone 3 or 4 hours and don't know why. I don't remember leaving or walking home. All of a sudden I was walking up to my door at home. Mother was mad because I was gone so long. I told her why and she just shrugged it off as if oh yeah sure you did !",
