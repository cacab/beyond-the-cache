  "observed": "It was Friday, January 25, 2001.  At first I was not even going to go down to the area were I and a friend saw a bigfoot.  I was going to finish watching the Pagosa Basketball team play and go home. But a boxing match was on the same night and my best friend's (not the friend that saw it with me) brother-in-law was going to buy it on Pay per View, and his brother-in-law lives in the area of Cromo and Edith, Colorado.  There are always some crazy sightings of UFO's and Bigfoot sightings. I really didn't believe in these type of things until I saw one for myself. We watched the boxing match and after it was over we started to head back to Pagosa Springs on Cromo Rd and we were almost to Highway 84 when about 20 yards in front of us this thing or big foot crossed and went quickly, almost as if we were seeing things. I didn't know what to think, so I asked Sammy if he saw it, and he said, What was that?  We got up to where it crossed and I opened my door to look down on the road and saw a foot print and Sammy opened his door and saw a track too. We both freaked out and I drove as fast I could to Pagosa Springs. We didn't tell that many people, only the ones that would believe us. ",
