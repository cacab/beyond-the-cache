  "observed": "We started hunting this 80 acres around 2003. I was  sitting in my Deer stand when some dogs came barking through the woods like they were chasing something.  They went up into this corner where the woods and the fenceline meet and started rolling around in the dirt and barking so I got down to run the dogs off and to see what they was rolling on and when I got to the corner I could smell something that smelled like dead animal, musky and sour.  Then as I turned something across the powerline in the woods approximately 50 yards away let out this deep long growl.   I have never heard anything like this in my life so I started backing away and when I got to the path I ran to our truck. After we got home my husband and I looked up growl sounds and I never could find anything that sounded like this it was horrifying to me! I also had another incident with my husband back in  about 2003 we was going out there to this property and feeding the deer. We was on our four wheeler and we drove to the powerline and the man who owned the property had been there and bush hogged  and had moved some tin that was laying there and the grass  was dead where  the tin had been lying. Right in the middle was a cell phone so my husband picked it up and It have been chewed on by dogs are coyotes or something so he laid it up on the tin  which was about 4 feet away.  So we filled our deer feeders and left. We come back the next day job to the powerline and the cell phone was back in the dead grass area exactly where we had first found it.  So my husband picked it up put it back on the tin.  So we check the feeders and left. We come back the next day drove back to the powerline and the cell phone was gone and they're in the dead grass area laid a piece of pipe  about 2 foot long so we picked up the pipe and put it on the tin  and we left. We didn't get to come back the next day but the following day we came back drove to the powerline and the pole was gone but there in the dead grass laid a little white button. It  was the kind of button you see on mobile home ceilings.  By this time we was freaking out. So we put the button on the tin  and I laid in the dead grass area a ponytail holder I had and also I mint.  Nothing took the ponytail holder or mint.  My husband found the cell phone again approximately 75 yards up  the Powerline about a month later but we never seen the pipe or the button again",
