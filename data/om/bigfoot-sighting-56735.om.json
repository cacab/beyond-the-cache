  "observed": "I was driving south on Batesville-Pike Rd on my way to work.  There are woods on both sides of this road with a tall chain link fence surrounding the woods on both sides.  The right hand side of the road is part of Camp Robinson.  Just past the fence there is a fire break before the tree line begins.  I had just driven around a sharp curve and due to the curve I was driving pretty slow.  There are lots of deer in this area and I am typically looking to see if any are close by.  There is a small creek bed in the curve with a large culvert running under the road connecting both sides of the street in that area.  Just past the curve I saw a tall, upright, black figure.  It was about 10 yards past the beginning of the treeline.  This creature was walking at an angle through the woods towards the creek.  I saw his right profile and the back of him. It appeared to have arms which were hanging at his side. There are lots of trees in this area so parts of his profile were blocked at times.  All of the leaves are off the trees at this so I had a pretty clear view.  He appeared to be 6-7 feet tall with black hair.  I'm not exactly sure what I saw but I know that it wasn't a deer.  This road has a pretty high amount of traffic in the morning and is highly guarded by Camp Robinson.",
