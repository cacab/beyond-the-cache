  "observed": "I was driving on Rd 1 in Salt Fork State Park from the back entrance. I was around 30 yards from the turn off for Hosak's Cave when I saw a hairy, brown figure move into the brush on the right side of the road. Now I know what a deer backside looks like and it wasn't a bear. When I went back later after work is when we found a foot print.",
