  "observed": "In 2002, in early fall (it was still nice outside) I was driving to work.  Ahead of me, on the crest of a hill, I saw a creature crossing the road.  It did not remind me of a monkey.  The legs and torso were too long.  It was on all fours at first; the limbs were substantial.  It was covered with dark brown longish hair.  It started across the road on all fours; the back limbs looked about the same length as the front limbs.  It was not great big and bulky; however it was of considerable size.  There was quite a bit of room between the stomach area and the ground.  Very tall in that way.  After a few steps, it stood up and took a couple of huge running steps, as if trying to hurry up.  Then it leaped up over about a 6'  embankment and a fence.  I went back later on after work to the site, and there were numerous footprints of all kinds of game; obviously it was a frequently used crossing for all sorts of animals.",
