  "observed": "I was walking in the woods behind the resort. It was pretty quiet, all I could hear was the Cle Elum river down below. I looked through the trees and saw an auburn colored Sasquatch walking. At first I thought it couldn't be a Sasquatch, there are people at the lodge. But as I looked again it's whole body was covered in shaggy auburn hair. I then thought it couldn't be a person, I've never seen anyone wear a snow suit that looks like that.",
