  "observed": "I never said anything of this to my parents or relatives, but I had talked of this to my friends.  I live in Maryland, but my relatives own a cabin in Pennsylvania, around Gettysburg I believe, and I was about seven or ten years old, I can't recall, I'm 17 now, and I was asleep in one of the rooms that's close to the front door of this cabin. The cabin is located semi deep into the woods on this mountain that I would climb and hike upon regularly.  The cabin is pretty old.  It has three floors.  A long driveway goes up to this cabin and there's a flight of stairs one must go up to reach the front door on the front porch.  It's about a 15-foot drop if you were to go off of this porch. Anyways, I was trying to fall asleep (and everyone else was asleep that was staying that night) and it was about 10 PM I guess when I heard a few stomps outside of my window.  The porch makes noise as it is an old cabin, but these stomps were pretty heavy and sounded as if whatever was making the noises' feet were dragging. Naturally, being as young as I was and knowing the fact that everyone that was going to be staying with us was there and already, I was quite frightened.  I made no sounds, but I sat up in my bed and looked at the window which had a curtain over it so it was impossible to see clearly what was out there.  The moonlight shined directly to that window, however, so if something were to pass by I would see it.  And pass by something did. Slowly, kind of just slumping along, was this shadow stomping by my window.  I'd say it was about 5 to 6 1/2 feet tall, with a fairly large head and very broad shoulders. Immediately after witnessing this, at my young age, I retreated under my blanket and feel asleep with fear. The next morning, I went out to the porch to investigate.  Towards the end of the porch, which was where the window was that I had seen the shadow pass by, was a very large footprint that was clearly visible.  It was visible because surrounding it, making it apparent was dirt and a bit of grass.  But, the odd thing about that was that the porch was insanely clean (my grandfather is a clean freak.).  Needless to say, this event has stuck with me.",
