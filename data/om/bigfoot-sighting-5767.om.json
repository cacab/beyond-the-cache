  "observed": "In 1975, North of Switzer Ski area, 6 of us saw a young one about the size of a 10 year old boy.  He looked like a 10 year old boy with hair all over it.  He walked accross the logging road about 40 yards ahead of us.  He turned and looked right at us.  While he was crossing us there in the brushy draw, you could hear something that sounded like a Howler Monkey, it appeared to be his Mother. Later that Fall, about 2 miles South of there, the one that I took to be his Mother, hung around for a couple years.  She was maybe less than 5 feet tall, and heavy built with short legs.  She was yellow, about the color of a yellow Cocker Spaniel.  She had long beautiful wavy hair and her hair on her head was long enough you could not see her ears.  She would come up and eat cob with molasses on it out of the horse pen. In 1975, we had built a little plywood shack, and we did not have enough plywood to fill in one side. It had rained til the Forest Service put a cable accross the road.  We could not get in there for a couple days.  When we got up there, the big one had taken the boards off the one side off the shack, and threw them in a pile.  She went in and picked up a 100 pound sack of horse feed, and carried it out to the other side of the house, and set it out on a roadbank and tore a hole in the center of the sack, sat down beside it, and ate out of it. Later that Fall, my  Son and Daughter and I were waiting for a Man to pick up a load of Cedar waste,  I had taken a Dutch oven full of Enchiladas and we heated them over the coals, when the dog started running back and forth and looking up the hill.  I told my kids that I thought there was a bear or cougar up there.  We'd go see.  We went maybe 100 yards down the road, and started up the hill toward the old lookout tower.  The stumps were 8 to 10 feet tall in the area, and our Sasquatch was real good keeping a stump between us so you could not get a good look at her.  At that time I was in pretty good shape and could out run her going uphill. My Daughter could out run her too.  Sasquatch came to a place where the stumps were pretty far apart, and put her hand up on a stump, and turned around and looked at us.  She kept going on up the hill until she came to the next road where a logger had fell the logs on the side of the road.  They were about 12-18 inches at the base and laid out across the little hill and they still had the limbs on them.  She turned around again and started crawling back under the logs. The dog and I were about 8 feet from her.  She was hissing like a cat and swatting at the dog with her hands.  She had hands with nails on them just like a persons hands.  I heard my Daughter screaming and she was running down the hill just as fast as she could go.  I'm not a coward, but I didn't have the guts to crawl under the logs to get a better look at her. I never got but one more good look at her.  A year later the Hound Hunter was running bears with his hounds and he treed this yellow Sasquatch.  I knew him and his hounds real well, and was about 300 yards across the canyon from him.  He grabbed his hounds, and loaded them up and left.  I don't know where she went.  I never did see her again after he left, he never came back in there with his hounds.  I ran into him in Sandpoint and asked him what he treed with his hounds that day, and he denied even being there.",
