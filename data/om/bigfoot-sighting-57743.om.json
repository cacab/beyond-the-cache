  "observed": "We are Southern California residents who were in Washington scouting for places to move after I retire next year.  We were renting a cabin on Lake St. Claire near the Nisqually Indian Reservation.  One afternoon we decided to take the kayak out. We were on the lake for about an hour, it was dead quiet except the occasional bird or splash from a fish in the lake, when we heard this loud mournful yell that echoed all around us. My wife froze and looked at me and said \"What the hell was that?\"  I was trying to make sense of it and it didn't sound like the howl of a dog. It sounded more human like a mid to upper range of a bass singer holding a long mournful note but more guttural at the end, and LOUD very LOUD. Like I said it echoed all around us so it was impossible to get a fix on direction. I told my wife I really didn't know, to wit she said \"Time to go back\" and we returned to the cabin.  When we got back to the cabin instead of going inside I turned on my phone hoping to catch it on video.  I would let the camera go for a minute then stop and then record for another minute. I hit pay dirt on the third try.  The recording is a little thrown off by the cabin inhabitant next to us trying to start a jetski or boat but it starts immediately after the engine is cut off again. Then one more after shorter one right after. Didn't hear or see anything after the recording it was the last time we heard it. Recording available upon request.",
