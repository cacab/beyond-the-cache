  "observed": "I stopped at a Nature Preserve to hike. On my way in, I had passed at least 14 people at various ways on their way out. I had walked down across the bridge and was looping back and it was about 4pm, As I was rounding a bend, I heard something big run away in the woods. I thought I had scared a deer and continued on. This is when I rounded the bend and saw a print on the trail going the opposite direction of whatever I heard scamper away. The ground was hard and the print was only about 1/4\" in the dirt. There were no other people prints or anything on the trail, As I'm taking pictures, something crashes in the trees above me... I covered my head waiting for a big branch to fall on me. After that, I high tailed it out of there. I left passing another half a dozen people on their way in as I made my way out. I never expected or was looking for anything on such a populated path. If it wasn't for the fact I had heard something right before and right after I found the print, I would have seriously leaned toward a fake.",
