  "observed": "Date:  Mid October, 1987 Weather:  No wind, very still, partly cloudy Time:  About (15) minutes after sunrise, around 0645 hours. Temperature:  40's farenheit Nearest town:  Murphy, Oklahoma.  Murphy has about (100) residents and is a very small town.  The town is in a remote location and has very little vehicle or pedestrian traffic.  Murphy is about (3) miles East of the incident location. Incident location description:  The area contains large sporadic open hay meadows.  The meadows are surrounded by densly forested small rolling hills. Numerous size creeks run through the location.  The Grand River is also located in the area. All types of wild game are in abundance. Tree stand description: I was bowhunting for deer.  The stand was on one of the above forested rolling hills.  I had located my stand in a tree that overlooked a very small creek.   A hilltop was directly behind me. The tree was abnormal in its shape because it grew almost sideways from the stump.  I was able to literally walk forward on the tree and get on my stand.  Very little climbing was involved.  The stand was about (8) feet off the ground and about half way down from the top of the hill.  The hill was about (5) stories high. Person reporting description:  I was (18) years old at the time of the incident.  I was wearing full fall camo clothing and had my face painted with camo paint.  I was wearing pure skunk scent to mask my scent. Person reporting summary:   I drove to the above location about (1) hour before daybreak.  I parked in a hay meadow and walked about a 1/2 mile towards my tree stand.   I walked quietly but I used a flashlight to navigate through the dense forest.  I climbed into my tree stand before sunrise.  I remained very still and waited silently.  As the sun rose, the woods soon became very active with squirrels running around my stand and birds singing in the trees.  I had been in my stand for about (20) minutes when the woods suddenly became still.  The birds stopped singing and the above squirrels had disappeared.  I found this very odd but I remained perfectly still in my stand.  About (5) minutes later, (3-4) small rocks were thrown in my direction.   The rocks were thrown from behind me. One struck the branches over my head and the other rocks landed on the ground within (10) yards in front of me.  I continued to remain perfectly still.  I then heard the sound of breaking branches behind me.  The sound came from the top of the hill and continued down towards my direction.  Something heavy footed was walking towards me from behind.  I continued to hear breaking branches but the sound now sounded like branches were being stepped on as well.  I also clearly heard the sound of footsteps in the leaves as the branches were being broken.  The creature definitely was not afraid of being heard and was approaching me in a bold manner. I continued to remain perfectly still.  The creature was breathing very heavy.  The creature's breathing was unique in that I did not hear him inhale.  The creature distinctly made his exhale breaths louder that his inhale breaths. The creature sounded like he was within (5) yards directly behind me.   I also smelled a \"musky\" odor when the creature approached me.  I continued to remain perfectly still.   The creature stood behind me for about (2-3) minutes and did not move.   The creature continued his distinct breathing.  The creature then gave a short snarling growl sound.  The creature then walked away stepping on branches as he left the area.  The creature sounded like he walked back towards the top of the hill directly behind me.  I no longer heard him after a few minutes.  About (5) minutes later, the woods became active again with the sound of birds singing and squirrels playing.  I remained still for about another (5) minutes.  I then quickly got down from my stand and ran towards the above open meadow.  I then got in my vehicle and left the area. Witnesses:  None.  I was alone. Physical evidence:  None.  I did not check due to fear. Damage/injuries:  None. Person reporting hypothesis of the incident:  I believe the creature was on the above hilltop and saw me arrive.  I believe he saw me walk to my stand and tried to make me leave by throwing rocks at me.  I believe the creature approached when I did not leave and tried to intimidate me with his branch breaking, deep breathing and growl. Credentials:  I retired in 2015 as a detective from the Tulsa Police Department after (18) years of service. Note:  I have experienced a lot of fearful moments in my life but this incident was definitely one of my worst encounters and will not be forgotten.",
