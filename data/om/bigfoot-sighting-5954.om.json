  "observed": "I was born and raised in Aliceville, Al. about a guarter mile from the City Park. In 1958 I was 14 years old. I played in the woods South of the Park and swam in the creek nearly every day.One afternoon just before dark I had been down near the creek at a small pond.This was before the City built sewer lagoon on that property. At that time there was a twenty or so acre sage brush patch there where they had not cultivated for years.That afternoon while walking from the lake back across the west end of that field I saw something walking a path along the eastern end.At first I thought it to be a huge man. That five foot tall sagebrush was strikeing hin about the waste.It was in plaine sight for about fifty yards and turned and went back into the woods. It must have been 8 ft. tall and walked with it's head slightly bent forward, very dark in color. I could tell it was the same color from waste to the top of it's head.The longer I looked I knew it wasn't human.I ran home and told my parents but I don't think they believed me.I never went in those woods alone again until I was much older.When a friend sent me your site on the net and I saw Aliceville on it I had to tell my story.",
