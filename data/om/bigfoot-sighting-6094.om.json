  "observed": "I was around 8 years old. It was about dusk when I walked into the cornfield that was directly behind our house. I played there alot. The corn was very tall. I first heard a noise, which sounded like heavy footsteps,and corn being pushed aside. I froze fearing that it was an escaped sow, but the footsteps sounded like a two legged step, not four. I froze when suddenly the corn in front of me split apart, and standing in front of me was a very tall, and very thick dark  figure.I did not look all the way up: I was very startled.There was a very strong odor.I can still smell it when I think about it. It was a very musky smell, and very strong. I was within arms length of whatever it was when it made a heavy sigh or grunt, kinda like a strong exhale, and then suddenly it just ran around me. Before I could turn to look again it was gone. My mother heard the footsteps, and the corn breaking, but did not see what I had seen.",
