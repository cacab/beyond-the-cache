  "observed": "I was traveling west on highway 104. I was traveling for work and headed toward Port Angeles. Traffic was very light as usual on this stretch of road. I had just crested a hill and spotted a car approaching from the west. It was a dark blue VW Rabbit or Golf. The vehicles met and I glanced in my rear view mirror in time to see the car approach the top of the hill. As the car reached the summit the sighting began. A creature appeared from the southern roadside and proceeded to walk across the highway and leave to the north. It was covered in reddish brown fur/hair and appeared to be about six foot tall. It had disproportionately long legs and even longer arms which hung to just above mid thigh. It seemed to not be in a hurry yet walked directly across the road. The vehicles were of no interest to it. I saw no facial features. I never looked away from the creature the entire time it took for it to cross the road. I stopped my truck at the next turn off about 500 yards and turned around [to go back] hoping to see more. As I approached the crossing area I slowed and searched the woods carefully for anything, but I saw no more.",
