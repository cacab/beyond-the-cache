  "observed": "I grew up in a very rural area of Tennessee.  My grandparents had a farm that lies on the border of Monroe and McMinn counties.  I was playing in the garage which is downhill from the house.  Across the road was a wooded area.  As I was playing I felt like someone was staring at me.  I looked up to find what I first thought was a very hairy man looking at me until I realized it didn't have on any clothes.  I became very frightened and dropped to the ground between cars and rolled up in underneath the car. It was dark  brown to black in color.  It was about seven feet tall as best that I can guess, It's facial features were similar to a humans.  I am pretty sure that it saw me.  I hid as soon as I saw it because it scared me quite badly. I  lay there for approximately 15 minutes. After awhile I heard men talking and crawled out from underneath the car.  I ran into the house and stayed  there for the rest of the day.  When I went into the house my mother asked  me what was wrong as I looked like I had seen a ghost.  At the time this area was thickly wooded.  These woods were soon cut down.  There are still wooded breaks between fields.  It was around two or three in the afternoon.  The time of year was around fall to early winter as I  can remember wearing a coat. The farm is approximately seven miles from  the town of Madisonville,  TN and three miles out of Englewood, TN.  It lies one mile from US HWY 411 in what is known as the Chestua community. Several of my relatives still live here.",
