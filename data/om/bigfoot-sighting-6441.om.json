  "observed": "Dear BFRO Persons, My family and I were staying in beautiful Grand Teton National Park for a  few nights and one night a mysterious yet real thing happened.  One night when we were all asleep the family dog started violently barking.  Everyone sprang to their feet to discover a large,hairy creature standing about 10ft. from our R.V.  It turned around and looked at the R.V. and started jogging off in a humanly way.  We were so amazed that nobody in the camper said a word until the next morning.  We went outside and there were huge footprints since it was damp and rainy.  We didn't get a \"good\" look at the animal but we still saw something that was hairy and very large.  The color was and still is unknown.  Thank you for your time. Sincerely (name edited)",
