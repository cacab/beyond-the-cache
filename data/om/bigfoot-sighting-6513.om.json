  "observed": "My wife and I were driving through Cogar, Oklahoma in the afternoon on our way to her parents house.  We were about 100 yards from approaching an intersection when I saw a [dark hair-covered, manlike] creature on two legs crossing the intersection we were about to turn on.  It was running fast and it looked like it possibly stepped over a barbwire fence. I also saw something black about 25 feet from the fence as if it had come to a sitting position and i kept my eyes on it and when i got to the intersection i turned to see if it was there but didnt see anything. I dont think what i had my eyes on was what i saw crossing the road but i did see something about 5-6 feet tall cross the intersection fast and step over the fence. My wife did not see it but told me that many sightings have been reported around there and so did her dad when we got there.  There has also been known to be a black panther in that area but this did not look like a panther.  I was really amazed at what i saw that day.  I never thought I'd see something like that. The road we were on had trees to the right and a farm to the left.  When I saw it crossing the road it could have been hiding in tall grass afterwards.",
