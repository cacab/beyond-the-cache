Then their bark became a whine and then a whimper.They just lay there shaking and became very quiet. I woke up and I quietlymoved my hand to my hand gun under my pillow. That's when you could heresomething walking in the water that smelled like a bucket of wet diapersor urine soaked fur. We kept our eyes shut and pretended to be asleep untilit was gone, the incident lasted about 4 minutes. Whatever it was brushedup against my hair as it slowly walked by... I thought I was going to die!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Especially after what we saw in the sand and all around the camp as soona day broke.....Very large foot type indentations made in dry, course riverbeach sand... unusual large prints left at wet sand but very mashed up... similar tracks all around area where we slept around campfire coalsand tent area.",
