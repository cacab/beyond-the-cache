  "observed": "My name is Dustin Anderson and my friends name is Dustin Evernden. We were riding our motorcycles one day and we decided to stop and rest for awhile.When we looked across the valley,we saw a large animal about 6'-7' tall,very wide shoulders,and walking on 2 legs. We watched it get up,walkaround on 2 feet,and sit down on nearby stump.We didn't go and check it out,because if we just happen to meet it on our way and it go balistic on us we might have been in a little of trouble.So we got the hell out of there.",
