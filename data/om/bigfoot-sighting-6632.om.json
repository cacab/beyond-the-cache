  "observed": "My family and I (my wife and two daughters, aged 10 and 15) were vacationing in Mammoth Cave State Park (Diamond Resort specifically) from June 27 - July 1, 2003.  We had a cabin situated on a golf course at the resort.  We were in the area that was furthest from the pool, clubhouse, tennis courts and all other facilities.  We were in a condominium and at the time were the only family staying there.  Just after sunset, while still dusk (Astronomical twilight would be the most accurate term), I heard a load scream.  At first, I dismissed it as a Coyote, but then I heard it again.  After this vocalization, I realized that every other sound had discontinued - no crickets, birds, dogs - nothing.  It was absolutely silent.  Being a curator for the BFRO since 1998, my interest was understandably piqued.  The third vocalization was absolutely unmistakeable - the nearest human counterpart would be that of a women being brutalized and screaming as a result.  I immediately contacted Matt Moneymaker by cell phone to see if we could hear it again, but that was the last time.  It was very difficult given the terrain to determine distance or even location.  After the incident, I personally yelled and heard echos from nearly every direction.  Other than my sighting at the age of 9, this is the only other experience that I have had.  There is no question in my mind that this was a Sasquatch.  Why he/she was vocalizing is anyone's guess!",
