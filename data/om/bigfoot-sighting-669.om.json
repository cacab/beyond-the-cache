  "observed": "While elk hunting with a friend,we decided to head back to the truck because it was geting dark. We both got the terrifying feeling we were being watched and followed. I heard a very loud frightening sream. The sounds were continuous for at least five minutes. Sound was just behind the trees and we could hear it banging on a tree and breaking branches. We hid behind some boulders with our rifles, waiting for the thing to come out but it did't. We were pretty scared by this time and headed back to the truck about 1/2 mile away. We set up camp about 15 miles away. That night we heard something circle ouround our camp about five times. We naver saw what it was but could tell it was large and heavy by the sound of it walking in the gravel on the ground.",
