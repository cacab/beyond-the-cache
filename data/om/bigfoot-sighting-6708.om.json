  "location_details": "I lived just north of Spring Hill on Sunshine Grove Rd by Hexim Rd. near your other report approximately 3 miles. What I saw was seen by 4 or 5 people over  20 to 30 years. By Whitehurst Lake about 2 miles from US 19. I saw a man-like thing approx 7 foot tall. Its arms were longer than a man. Its head was small. It walked labored, swinging its arms. It had no real shape to it that I could tell. Just big. It stopped on the lime rock road for 1 or 2 seconds, then walked toward the lake. I ran the other way. When I told my mother she said that they had seen them for years in the 70's.",
