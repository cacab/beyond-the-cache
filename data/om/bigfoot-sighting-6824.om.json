  "observed": "About ten years ago, some friends, and I took a midnight hike to remote camp on Mount Shasta. The moon was full, and we were able to do the hike without flashlights. When we got to camp we set up our tents, and then we proceeded to the campfire.  Since this camp is at the tree line, which is about 10,000 feet, you are not able to build your own fire. You are either at the main fire, or in your sleeping bag, because it is cold. As I sat at the fire, I, and only I, looked down to the meadow that has the trail you hike up on. I knew that my two friends were coming up the trail behind us, so when I saw a large man at the base of the trail (less than 100 yards away) I thought it was my large Native American friend with long hair. I did think that it was strange that he was standing in the meadow alone, without a backpack, at two o'clock in the morning. We looked at each other for a while and then he started to walk off into the forest. I thought that was bizarre also, since it was really cold and again, if you were not by the main fire, you were in your tent. After wondering what he was doing, I turned my attention back to the fire, expecting my two friends to show up at any minute. Well, they did not show up for another hour. I asked my friend why he was down in the field earlier without a backpack, and our friend, swore to me that they just arrived. I then knew what I saw, and I have been a believer ever since. Thank you for listening to my story.",
