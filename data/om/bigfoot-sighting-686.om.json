  "observed": "While fishing at a large beaver pond about 5 miles east of Gates, Oregon in the summer of 1994, I found a set of strange tracks in the mud along the pond's bank. The tracks came down off a slope behind me, and continued about 15-20 feet out into the water, where it appeared that the animal stopped. The tracks then made a banana loop back toward shore. Because of thick brush, I was not able to continue to follow them. Being a skeptic, I went home without thinking much more about it. I then told my brother-in-law about the tracks the next day, and he asked me to take him to them. Bringing along some plaster, we headed back to the pond. The tracks were still visible, and had even begun to dry in the sun. The tracks measured about 18 inches long and had only four toes. The animal had to be very heavy because the inprint was very deep. We took a cast of the track, and started to head home, when we found a dead, half eaten beaver in the brush. The only thing strange about this was that this was the direction that the tracks had been heading, and it appeared that something big had been in the brush. The beaver had been picked apart, not torn apart, almost like something was looking for the tastiest entrails. My brother-in-law called 1-800-bigfoot,and submitted a report, so I'm sure you have made note of this incident. Only now have I become aware of this Web Site, and I wish to obtain more info on this subject. I am mostly interested in other sightings in the Mill City/Gates area. Being a long time resident of the Santiam Canyon, I would like to hear if anyone else from the area had had similar experiences. I have heard many other stories from loggers,hunters,trappers etc, and have begun to explore these further. Now that I have access to E-mail I would like to be able to share some of these stories with you. Thank You",
