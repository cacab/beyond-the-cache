  "observed": "Was walking down a little dirt road at daylight. I was elk scouting, when I come out into the edge of the clear-cut at the bottom of the hill. I just started out where I could see the top, which the road I was on led up, when I seen some movement. I watched for a second and could not believe my eyes. At first it almost looked like to bears standing up on their hind legs facing each other. They were at about 300 yards. I put my binoculars on them and I witnessed what seemed to be TWO YOUNG BIGFOOT PLAYING. I watched them jump around chasing each other and jump up and hit there hands together for about a minute, then all of a sudden they both just stopped and walked off together into the thick trees. they were about five and a half feet tall with hands down to almost there knees, with long brown hair. They looked just like pictures I seen in Walla Walla Washington sightings like two years later.",
