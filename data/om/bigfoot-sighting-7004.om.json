  "observed": "Date: October 2003. Place: Cherokee County, Georgia Conditions: Clear, Crisp Weekday Morning I live in Cheokee County, Georgia in a semi-rural area of small horse farms and subdivisions. My ususal routine is to walk my two dogs early in the morning off my property on an improved road and back to the house. Upon entering the house at approx 5:45 AM we (the dogs and I) were startled by a series of very loud \"vocalizations\" coming from the direction of our horse barn (approx 200 ft away beyond a creek and tree line). At this time of morning I am familiar with the usual sounds of the area, including dogs, cats, horses, etc.  This was like nothing I have ever heard before as it was very wild and loud animalistic \"yell\", but with a human vocal quality that immediately caught my attention. The second \"yell\" was almost \"monkey-like\" vocalizations and moving off to the western edge of the property. I went down to feed the horses and did not see or hear anything unusual. I have not looked for tracks or evidence as of four days later.",
