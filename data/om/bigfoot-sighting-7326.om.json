  "observed": "I was deer hunting alone and had been in my stand about 15 minutes, when I heard someone approach.I spoke loudly that this was private land when a smell of a heavy musky smell hit me and whatever it was began to run circles around me, about 75 yards away. I coul see a dark shape, but it was misty and still a little dark. After about 4-5 minutes it turned and ran off. Noone has ever believd me, but I encountered the smell several other times, which I can say smelled like a wet bear, which I now pursue frequently.That was the only time anywhere that I felt not in control even though I had my rifle. AnimalSeen : dark form in mist that sounded to run on 2 legs.",
