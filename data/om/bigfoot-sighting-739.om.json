  "observed": "One Saturday evening at about 6:30 PM in October, a friend and I where walking along the Ninascah river and saw eight to ten very large foot prints in the sand. The prints where eleven to fourteen inches long and about six inches wide in the largest spot. Right away I knew that the tracks where not human, they had to belong to bigfoot. The prints had five toe marks at the end. They were about 1/2 a mile from the rocky dam under a bridge. The tracks led to the water, and could not be followed.",
