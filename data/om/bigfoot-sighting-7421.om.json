  "observed": "My boyfriend and two sons (age 5 & 10) were camping in Upton, Maine.  On July 3rd, 1998 we took a ride into Parmachenee Lake.  The road to get there is off Rt. 16 in Wilsons Mills, ME.  We drove around most of the day, stopped for a cookout on someones lot and then headed out in the early afternoon.   It was before 4:00 p.m.   We were riding in a truck, my friend driving and the two boys in the middle and I was on the passenger side.   We came out of what I would call a wooded area at the top of a small hill, the hill rounded a small corner and then straightened out at the bottom.  The entire area on the right side was an open area at the bottom, the left side was wooded.  There were no vehicles around there or anywhere for that matter.   Just as we rounded we could see at the very bottom of the slight downgrade (approx. 100-150 yds).   We both saw it at the same time.  He looked at me immediately and said \"what did you just see\", I looked at him and without even thinking and said \"saskatchewan\". What we saw was something unimaginable.   The creature (?) was standing on two legs, was very tall (approx. 7 feet), skinney and was totally covered with long brown hair/fur.  What was amazing was this creature never even acknowledged that we were coming towards him in the truck, although we were not close enough to hit it, it never acknowledged.   The other amazing thing was that it's strides were huge.  It took it probably three strides to cross the dirt road, which was wide enough for two vehicles.   It's gait was very stoic.   We got down to the bottom within seconds, we slowed right down almost to a stop and looked into the woods.   There was nothing in there.   My boyfriend wanted to stop but I wouldn't let him because of the children.  We also stopped discussing it at that time in fear of scaring the kids.  There were no tracks on the ground.   We intended to return the next day to see if we could track anything but it rained really hard that night so we figured any tracks were gone. I told this story to very few people because I know it's hard to believe.   I did tell one of the foresters that worked where I did.   This road we went on is gated and I was able to get a key from my employer.   This is why I mentioned it to the forester.  I was hoping maybe he had heard similar stories. The creature was on Bose Buck Mountain and headed towards Aziscohos Lake.   Also in that area was an old gate near mile marker #12.",
