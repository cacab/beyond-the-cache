  "observed": "I am a photographer who lives in northeast Ohio. A few years ago while I was out with my camera one afternoon I heard what I thought were Bigfoot howls or moans in Beaver Creek State Park. Some time later I heard them again in the very same place. The reason I have not reported this before is because I do not want to be laughed at or thought to be crazy. In April of 1999 while I was walking in the park again I started up a hill and was overcome with the sense of being watched. As I walked out of the park I had noticed there were no other people located in my vicinity. I also noticed the spider webs were still across the trail, so no one had been there before me that morning.",
