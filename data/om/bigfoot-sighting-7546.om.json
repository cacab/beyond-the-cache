  "observed": "One night in mid-October of 1999, around 9:45 at night, my daughter and I were coming home from Kilgore. I had my high beams on. Up ahead I noticed something on the right side of the road, and I continued watch it as we got closer, and slowed down a little, because I was afraid it might be a dog or something and run out in front of us. As I got closer, I noticed that it wasn't a dog, but some thing much bigger, and appeared to be crouched over beside the road. It turned toward us and stood up. There is a steep drop right off the shoulder of the road, and the thing just took about 2 steps and disappeared into the woods. I had started to tell my daughter to look, but cut myself short when the thing stood up and looked toward the car. I was just dumbstruck, I had never seen anything like it!!!! I just drove us home as fast as I could. My 8 year old was asking me all the way, \"What was it mommy?\" and all I could say was \"I don't know...\". My husband could tell something was wrong when we got home, because he told me I was as white as a sheet. The hair was still standing up all on my arms! I decided to make this report after my oldest daughter came home last January, very upset and talking about a \"monkey-man\" that had run in front of her car. I asked her to tell me where it had happened, and it was not a half mile from where I had seen the \"thing\". Both of these locations are within 3 miles of our home.",
