  "observed": "I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING.  I DID HEAR A LOT.  WHILE IN A BOAT FISHING WITH TWO FRIENDS WE WERE ALONG THE SHORE LINE JOKING AROUND AND TRYING TO CATCH SOMETHING WHEN WE HEARD A VERY LARGE ANIMAL RUSTLING IN THE WOODS.  THE ANIMAL/OBJECT WAS NOT ALL THAT FAR FROM US BUT WE COULD NOT SEE DUE TO THE DENSE VEGITATION AND THE LOW LIGHT CONDITION.  THE CREATURE DID SOUND TO BE VERY LARGE AND THE THRASHING OF THE VEGITATION BECAME LOUDER.  THE THREE OF US IN THE BOAT DID BEGIN TO SPECULATE WHAT WE WERE HEARING AND NONE OF US WERE WORRIED UNTIL WE HEARD THE SHRILL FROM THIS ANIMAL.  IT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS VERY LOUD, BONE CHILLING AND IN DID STRIKE FEAR IN ALL OF US.  WE BEGAN TO PULL OUR LINES AND START THE BOAT ASAP TO LEAVE THE AREA AND THE ANIMAL BEGAN TO RUN AWAY FROM OUR LOCATION.  I THINK THE DIRECTION WAS S/E.  WE STILL COULD HEAR THE ANIMAL MOVING THROUGH THE DENSE VEGITATION AT A FAST FACE WITH NO APPARENT PROBLEM.  THE ANIMAL CONTINUED TO SHRILL ON OCCASION STOPP ING APPROX. EVERY 200YDS.  THE DISTANCE THE FINAL SHRILL WAS HEARD AT WAS APPROX. 1/4 TO 1/2 A MILE AWAY THROUGH DENSE WOODS, UP HILL.  THE TIME FRAME WHICH THIS TOOK PLACE IN WAS SO FAST WE WERE UNABLE TO THINK OF AN ANIMAL WHICH COULD SOUND SO LARGE, HAVE SUCH A DEEP SHRILL, AND MOVE SO FAST.  THE SHRILL WAS NOT AS ANY OTHER ANIMAL I HAVE EVER HEARD NOR WAS IT TO THE TWO OTHER PEOPLE I WAS WITH.  THE SHRILL WAS LATER HEARD BY BE APPROX. 2YRS LATER WHILE ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK IN WI.  I WAS LISTENING TO ART BELL AND BIG FOOT WAS THE TOPIC AND SOMEBODY HAD AN AUDIO OF A BIG FOOT.  WHEN THE AUDIO WAS PLAYED I AGAIN BECAME AFRAID, SPEACHLESS, THE HAIR ON MY NECK STOOD UP AND MY EYES TEARED.",
