Something carried off deer feed bucket made a big mess out at feeder area. This is ongoing noise as this house is in a very remote area of woods/creek/pond and deep ravines.  My horses were so spooked from the screams that they were running into the fences I had to calm them down.  This house sits in the middle of the 30 acres wooded area.",
