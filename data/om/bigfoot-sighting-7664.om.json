  "observed": "Around 11 pm returning to Commerce along Hwy. 50, as I approached the Sulphur River bottom I noticed movement along the east side of the highway near the shoulder. There was another vehicle heading south coming from the opposite direction of my travel. At first I thought it was just a shadow caused by the on coming cars headlights. As I got closer the object I had noticed moved quickly across the road heading west. What I saw was a very large animal that walked upright, but just slightly slumped forward as it moved. It did not run but took very long steps as it moved. As I passed where the animal had crossed I slowed down to look. I could not see anything. I believe the oncoming car also saw the animal as it braked when it went by the spot as well. The car did not brake because I had slowed down. Once the car had passed I decided to turn around and go back. I saw nothing else. It was dark that night with very little light from the moon the best that I can remember.",
