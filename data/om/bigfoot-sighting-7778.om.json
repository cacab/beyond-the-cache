  "observed": "I am a land surveyor who was performing a large boundary survey adjacent to The Tejon Ranch while driving along an old ridge line road, I encountered a black figure amongst the trees.  I originally took it for a tall tree stump or sprag until it began to move.  After it began moving I thought it may be a bear.  As I came closer, I realized that it was too thin and tall to be a bear.  Finally as I came within 75 feet of it, it sprinted across the road and disappeared into the trees.",
