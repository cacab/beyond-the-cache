  "observed": "One afternoon I was riding my bike on my grandfather's farm through an alfalfa field. I was approaching a small crest on a hill and started coasting down. About 300 feet away to my left I noticed this huge hair covered creature coming up the hill towards the cornfield. When it noticed me, it stopped and turned back towards the woodline. I stopped my bike and watched as it went down the hill into the woods. When I stopped, it swung its body to look at me. Then, it started to run down the hill and out of sight. When it went down the hill it stumbled and made a strong grunt like noise. I rode back to the house as fast as I could to tell everyone what I just saw. My grandparents didn't believe me and said I was just seeing things. ",
