  "observed": "One night I was riding my off road motorcycle on the family property when I stopped to pet one of our dogs. I shined my flashlight at the dog when I noticed behind the dog something was squatting in the ditch. I shined my light on the thing in the ditch and it stood upright. What I was looking at was a tall hairy creature of some sort that had very wide shoulders and glowing green eyes. I quickly panicked and jumped back onto my motorbike, started it up, and raced away. The creature started to chase me down the old railroad towards my house. I knew it was chasing me because since I wasn't wearing a helmet, I could turn around and see the creature running after me. As I approached a pond area, I hit a ditch and flipped my motorbike over and became scuffed up. At this time, the creature stopped chasing me and starting walking towards me. I panicked again and started my bike by rolling down the hill and letting the clutch out. As I approached my house, I wrecked again at the base of our driveway and ran to the house. The creature followed me to my house and didn't leave until I turned the large floodlight on in our front yard. I feel like the creature could have caught me at anytime. Then, it ran off to a dried up swamp area and I didn't see it again.",
