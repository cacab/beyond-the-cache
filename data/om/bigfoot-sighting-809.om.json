  "observed": "First Incident: When I was about 7 years old we were at Lake Superior on the beach.  We found a set of footprints in the sand.  They were very large.  My parents said they were a lot larger then a normal footprint would be, even for a large adult.  (When your only 7 anything would seem big.)  Later when we were leaving, we heard a screeching that sounded similar to a screech owl, or a primate at the zoo.  (This is the best I can describe it.)  A Very Large \"something\" also started jumping up and down fairly close to us. We were in the woods near the lake almost to the car at the time.  We couldn't see what it was but it didn't appear to want us around.  My mom thought in may have been college students playing a prank or on drugs.  It was to big for that.  I wanted to go see what it was, but my parents let me.  We left in the car quickly.  A few days later there was an article in the Mining Journal (local newspaper)  that some guy and his girlfriend saw a bigfoot on an old road in the same area.",
