  "observed": "In September of 1997 while traveling north on route 610 in Worcester county MD. at around 11:00 PM my bother and I saw a figure on the side of the road. It was very large and dark the light did not seem to reflect off of it, honestly it was as if the outline was what caught our eye. Since we were in my Suburban I could tell very easily that what ever we were seeing was tall. I recall that my brother was so shocked he even jumped away from my side of the truck which is where the figure was. Even to this day the thought of what we saw makes my hair stand up. The figure stood motinless facing towards the east,it made no movement what so ever. I remember the light that was reflected from it's eyes was a white/silvery color. Michael and I said very little on the way home that night and we rarely speak of it today.",
