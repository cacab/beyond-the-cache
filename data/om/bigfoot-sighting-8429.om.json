  "observed": "My mother and I had taken my young Doberman to the Honey Island Swamp to let him run and get some exercise.  We had driven to the end of the road where the bridge had collapsed and you could not go any further back by car.  The area is a few miles from the Honey Island exit off of Interstate 59 in Mississipi. The road was built up about 8 feet from the ground since it flooded back there.  The area around the road was swampy and had a lot trees.  The ground was covered in leaves since it was fall.  We had been there about ten minutes and my dog had been pretty much just staying on the road as he ran around.  I went to get something out of the car and when I started walking back to where my mother was on the road, she was looking out into the wooded area at something.  She pointed out what appeared to be something dark beside a large cypress tree.  We could not make out a head, but it appeared to be a grey/black fur covered torso.  Whatever we were looking at was large because it stood above some bushes and the top part was behind the branches of the tree.  It had to have been well over 6 feet tall, since the bushes were at least 3 feet tall.  It was definitely not another tree because the texture was so different from the big tree it was next to.  It was approximately 1:00 pm and the sun was bright.  The light was dappled through the tree cover, but we could see that it was shining off of what appeared to be hair or something with a \"hairy\" texture.  It seemed to shift back and forth, as if you were to shift your weight from one leg to another.  It was probably 50 to 75 feet away from us, so we could not get a real good look at it.  We did not hear or smell anything and my dog did not seem to notice anything out of the ordinary.  After looking at it for at least 2 - 3 minutes, we got very uncomfortable and decided that we would drive a mile or so up past one of the bridges on the way back to the interstate.  We put my dog in the car and drove at least a mile up the road before we stopped again to let my dog back out.  We had been there approximately 5 minutes when we heard footsteps in the woods.  We could hear them getting closer.  This time, my dog picked up on the sound and became alert.  We could hear it stop and then move forward a few steps a couple times.  We could not see anything, but my dog was definitely trying to figure out what he was hearing.  We got a little scared, so we loaded up again and this time drove up to where there are some nature trails and a shooting range (probably at least 1.5 to 2 miles up the road).  We got out of the car again and were not there 2 minutes when we heard what sounded like something running through the woods toward us.  At that point, my dog got so scared that he ran back to the car and hit the closed car door to try to get back in.  My mother and I ran to the car and all three of us got out of there as fast as we could.  We never saw what was making the noise in the woods, but whatever it was, was big enough to make a lot of noise both walking and especially running through the woods.  After leaving and having major discussion about what had happened, my mother and I got our nerve up to go back to the end of the road later that day (about 4:00 pm) to see if what we had seen earlier was still there.  When we got there, we could not find what we had seen before.  We saw what we are pretty sure was the big tree, but we didn't see what was by it originally.  We were not brave enough to go down into the wooded area for a closer look, so we basically left with even more questions than we started out with.  We never had a clear view of what we saw, but what we heard, definitely scared us.",
