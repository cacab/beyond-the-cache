  "observed": "In January of this year (04) my girlfriend and I were on our way to visit family in Kountz, Texas.  We share an apartment in a suburb of Houston.  The quickest route to my mom and stepdad's house is through Cleveland, Texas and take 105 from there to almost Kountz. [At] approximately midnight,  we left from Kingwood and traveled through Cleveland onto 105. We had been on 105 about 20 minutes (about 45 minutes from Kingwood) we were approaching the Trinity River bottom when I noticed something in the center of the road.  My girlfriend was dozing beside me and I yelled thinking we were about to be in an accident.  She sat up and screamed that we were about to hit 'him'.  I locked the brakes of her truck up and when I did whatever it was stood up in the road and started to 'run' to our right towards the woods. My girlfriend, started to open her door and I grabbed her to stop her.  She yelled that it was a 'bigfoot'.  I had heard of them, I mean who hasn't, but to be honest until that very moment, I would never have believed that they existed.  By the time I looked up from her the creature was standing on the side of the road watching us.  When she opened her door the creature made like a squalling sound and turned into the woods. I think it was around 7 feet tall.  I am not too sure I do know it was quite a bit taller then myself.  It was black in color but it had what looked like mud on its legs and arms.  The fur or hair was long.  It was on my girlfriend's side of the truck about 10 feet away and she said its hands were long and the thumbs were 'not right'.  I am not too sure what she meant other then they looked longer I think, too be honest not too sure how to describe that. Where the thing was squatting in the road was a doe that had been hit by a car.  I am not sure if it was looking or feeding on the doe but it had been moved by it.  You could see where the creature had shifted the animal on the road or at least it looked like that when I got out to look.  I have read on here, when I decided to post the incident. that there was an 'oder' a lot of times.  When we got out I really could not remember an oder or anything else that smelled strange. I am not too sure of what else to tell about what we saw.",
