  "observed": "Hello, about two years ago, I finally got the courage to tell a Bigfoot researcher in Ohio my story from many years ago. I don't remember his name, but I lost contact with him when my computer got hit by a power surge and all info was wiped out. In 1976, I was almost 13 years old. My family and I were camping at Atwood Lake. My favorite thing to do was to get on my bike, and walk in the woods collecting butterflies and bugs. One day I guess it was still before noon, I wandered up a hill by the cabins that were for rent on the edge of the lake. It was a little far even for me, but I was sure I'd find new bugs there. I had left my bike at the bottom of the hill and walked the path swishing my net. About 1/2 way up the path, I smelled something that was just like grass mounds when you cut the lawn and leave the grass to rot. Very musty. I don't remember exactly what made me look up but straight up the hill on the left hand side just off the path was this huge thing. It stood upright like a man but had longer dark hair and a face sorta small looking from the hair and a slightly pointed head towards the back. It looked my direction and I froze. I remember gasping for air and ran down the hill thinking it surely was chasing me. I don't know if it did, but if it had decided to come after me, it could have easily come down the hill where I rode my bicycle and caught me. I raced back to the camp site but didn't tell my parents or cousins for fear I'd never be allowed to go off by myself again. Oddly enough, I didn't go past the fields edge very close to camp after that. I don't know if you believe me or not? I know what I saw so many years ago.You don't forget it......and for as much as I've ever glued myself to anything regarding Bigfoot, I know they exist, and I believe they are peaceful. You're welcome to email me. It would be nice to know at 39 that I'm not the only one. I know what I saw and smelled was real. Thanks for your time.",
