  "observed": "I live in the Cascade foothills 10 miles east of Duvall.About 1200 feet up. My husband and I had 2 very large foot prints in our vegetable garden They were perfect because the dirt was just tilled for spring planting. The space between the foot prints was way to wide to be human. We didn't use plaster for an impression or get a picture, but we both know it was bigfoot. My father inlaw saw them too and could'nt explain them. It is kinda neat to think a bigfoot walked threw our yard right in front of our house. I wonder if they are up in the forest watching us work in the yard? We don't tell too many people because they think you're nuts. I'm pretty careful who I tell. It's been about 4 or 5 years now. I decided to tell you because I just saw the discovery kids show on the bigfoot. Thank you",
