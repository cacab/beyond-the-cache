  "observed": "i had already put one report in , but i thought i would put a separte one in for this. here latly at my house both myself and my parents have heard nioses at night and in the day time around our house. once when my mom and dad were at aunt's house and it was close to dusk i heard what i thought was someone banging on my window. another time i heard what sounded like grunting out side my bedroom window. the other night while my parents and my self were out side we heard a load howl from across the road , we hear what appears to be growling and moaning to but we never see anything. the person who lives across the street says she has never heard it but she is either always gone or either has people over . in fact the other night my parents saw they hear a banging outside the back window. dad said it sounded as though someone wanted very badly to get in. my dog that is in the house never even growled. dad said that it was funny because he said that rocket (my dog) never got out from under the covers , and he heard it because dad said he felt him moving closer to him. one time while i was out feeding my cats at night i heard something running very fast across the road , i never saw anything. there have been serval times that i have heard grunting and rocks hitting the side of the house. my dogs in the back never even bark. i have 2 labs and a mix and he's huge but he never came out of his house  unless someone was out there with him at night. when me and my friend were outside talking one night we heard what sounded like breaking limbs. what ever was jumping or walking on the limbs was huge and when we walked behind the house to see known of my dogs were out and the noise stopped. then as we started back around the house it started again. but as we turned on his spot light the niose stopped. my mom said that she saw red eye crossing the road the other night but could not see anything. one after noon while my aunt , my mom and myself were walking in her small group of trees on her side of the road right in front of house. i walked on ahead and came to the fence that seperated her line from the other owner . i say what looked like one of the teepee formations , but i did not get a good look becuase it was on the other side of the fence. i am not sure that this was one of the teepee that these creature make , but i wanted to metion it.",
