  "observed": "In 1998, January, I saw a large, light-colored, upright creature 10 miles south of my home in Bolivar County. I was driving north on highway 61 in southern Bolivar County when I saw about 200 yards ahead of me a large individual cross the road from left to right. When I reached the spot where it stopped in a ditch, it didn't look at me, but rather straight ahead. I would say it stood around 7 1/2-8 feet tall, and weighed about 450-500 pounds.",
