  "observed": "In 1981 my brother-in-law and I were racoon hunting with three good dogs in the South Boston, Indiana 47167 area. We were avid coon hunters at the time because I was laid off from my job. Well one night during hunting season we let the dogs out at one of our favorite spots and very soon the dogs hit trail. They ran across the road the wrong direction to what I wanted and they ran for about a minute. Then we heard the loudest most horrible scream I've ever heard. It lasted maybe fifteen seconds. The volume was greater then any human or any bobcat, bear, coyote, fox or anything that lives in my area. My three good dogs went silent and came running back and my best dog stood between my legs looking in the direction of the noise. I said \"Roger, what the heck was that?\" Roger said he had no idea. I told him to load the gun, which we never carried loaded because of fear of an accident, and he fiddled around until I took it and loaded it myself. Meanwhile my dogs were bumping into my legs and still looking into the woods. Well we slowly walked backwards to the car and instead of loading the dogs into the trunk they jumped into the back seat before I could stop them weather I wanted to or not. That ended my coon hunting for the night. Now the howl you have on this site named publicklam.wav might sound like a baby one compared to what I heard. The sound I heard had much volume and much force.",
