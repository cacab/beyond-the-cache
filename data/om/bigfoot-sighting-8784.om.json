  "observed": "After midnight in the fall of 1992 up in Burney CA, my mother comes and wakes me up to listen to a noise she just heard outside. I walk out to our porch and wait for about 5 min. It is pretty cold out side so I'm about to go in side when I heard something that made my skin crawl, and my hair stand on end. The sound was very gutteral in nature, It sounded like chirpping and then it went into a scream that sounded like a cougar,bear,howler monkey rolled into one. It is really hard to explain the sound. I have heard it before on bigfoot documentaries since then. I went out to search for what made the noise and didn't see anything but there was a punget odor in the air.  At the time I did not associate the two. I went back inside. The next morning our next door neighbor complained that someone was outside her window last night. She said her window shades were drawn but could see the silhouette of a head and shoulders. I asked her to show me what window it was. It was her back bedroom window that is at least 6-7 ft off the ground. The ground under her window was packed hard clay and there was no foot prints or anything.",
