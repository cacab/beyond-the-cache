  "observed": "On Monday June 7th at around 3:00 I went horseback riding at a friends house. Shortly after I got out of the driveway and onto the dirt road the horse spooked and jumped sideways. I heard 2 HEAVY footsteps in the woods quite close to the road. You could hear small trees and branches beeing trampled. I saw a large white hairy figure moving quickly through the brush. It was hard to make out the complete figure. It was tall and big as far as I could see. Then as suddenly as it had happend the sounds were gone and I could no longer see anything. I have a few friends that are going to go up there with me next week to see if there are any signs of anything left at that spot.",
