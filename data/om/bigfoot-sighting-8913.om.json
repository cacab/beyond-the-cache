  "observed": "In May 2001, my wife and I were traveling from Pine Bluff, AR to Watson,AR, a town 16 miles east of Dumas, AR. It was late at night, about 1:00 a.m. I don't remember the exact date but it was late May. I'm not from this area and my wife's relatives had told me about sightings in the past. I wasn't convinced. However, on this night my attitude changed. My wife, of course, was asleep so I'm the only one that saw it. We were about five miles outside of Watson on Hwy. 1  when suddenly I saw a tremendous blur of white about 30 yards in front of the car. It was a large animal or man at least 7 feet tall tearing across the road. I yelled at my wife, \"did you see that?!\". Of course, she did not. But I believe what I saw to be a bigfoot or sasquatch.",
