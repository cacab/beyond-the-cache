  "observed": "I always wondered about this incident and I had even told my parents and a few friends about it.  I even thought about submitting it onto this site but I did not bother because it happened on an island(and I thought it was crazy).  When I read about the report(on this site) on Hartstene Island, my skin crawled and I decided that I had better do this.  I grew up on Hartstene Island. In 1984 my parents used to sell Xmas trees down in California, and I would stay at home alone for about three weeks. I was a junior in high school.  My older brother and his wife lived across the street, so I was never really THAT isolated.  We lived in a big house on a farm in an old fruit orchard,  with horses chickens and pigs.  Abby, our German Shephard was always around although sometimes she would dissappear at night, and I am sure that she was not at home with me the night that this happened because her barking would have woke me up.  And she sometimes used to go crazy barking at night, but we always dismissed it as deer, and sometimes you could hear twigs snapping out in the woods behind our house.  The woods behind our house went on for quite a ways......they had been logged off previously and so it was second or third growth that went way back, with no houses during that time. My parents were in California selling trees.  Our house was a big one story with lots of windows.  I always felt like I was being watched at night so I would go around and pull most of the curtains shut.  Beyond the yard light it was pitch black.  Our house was shaped like a T at that time and my bedroom was on the end left side of the T with the  kitchen being kind of in the top middle of the T.  There was a slider that opened from the kitchen out onto a covered deck.  The deck had two gates, and one of them opened up about two feet from the end of one of my bedroom windows, the bottom of which was about  five feet off of the ground.  I had gone to sleep and at about 230 AM I suddenly jerked awake for no reason and looked at the bedroom window that was on the right side of my bed.  Something black was outlined and all I could really see was a head, like it was trying to peer into the window as opposed to just standing there right in front of it.  Anyhow, it seemed at the time I saw it, whatever it was realized that I saw it and it took off running off of the porch, in the process making some clattering noise(clattering noises on wood) as it knocked something over.  At the time, I thought it could have been deer hooves, but why would a deer be on our porch leaned over the fence and looking in my window?  It ran off of the porch so fast then, right around my end of the house, which meant that I heard it running through the side yard by my room and then through the back yard.  It was incredibly fast and I could hear it crashing through the woods loudly.  It was so fast that I honestly cannot remember if it sounded like it was bipedal or not.  But I seriously doubt that a deer would stand up against the side of a house to look into a window at night, that does not make sense to me. Instinctively I felt like it was some sort of animal I had never seen beofre and not human. I was so scared that I closed my eyes and prayed because I could not understand why a deer would do that, and I thought it was a person but it ran way too fast. And I  was really creeped out that someone would take off running through the woods at the back of our house at 230 AM when they could have just ran back down the driveway.....    Needless to say, I stayed at my brothers house for most nights from that night until my parents came home.",
