  "observed": "In connection with report #8804, my house is approximately 5 miles south of this sighting.  Throughout the spring of 2004, our neighborhood was disturbed regularly by something walking through the woods at night.  Almost everyone in the neighborhood was affected, in that we would hear footsteps, twigs snapping, and one neighbor heard scratching on the side of the house.  Outside my kitchen window, which is about 8 feet off the ground, the plants are all smashed down like something repeatedly stood there.  My neighbor sleeps with his bedroom windows open and hears it approaching in the middle of the night.  The dogs in the area would absolutely go nuts!  He has night vision and just as soon as he gets outside, he hears the footsteps slowly moving away.  He never picked up anything on the nightvision.  In May 2004 I came home late, about midnight, and as I was exiting the car, I heared a the classic bigfoot scream way out in the distance, maybe half a mile away.  In July, it all suddenly ended and we haven't heard anything since.",
