  "observed": "This morning we were awaken up by the sound of tapping on what seemed like the window of our bedroom. We have three pit bull dogs and they are very agressive when they hear unusual noises but they were terrified by something outside. My son **** went out to see what the noise was and I followed him.  I noticed an awful smell, like something dead or nasty garbage. Then this huge man-like creature ran right in front of us and headed to the woods. I was scared and so was ****. We were both frightened. We just stood there frozen. We have alot of trees on our property and this thing was as tall as our orange tree (about 8 feet). We woke everyone up in the else and kept watching to see it was coming back.  We live on 3.6 acres of heavy wooded property on the edge of the Ocala National Forest. I have never seen anything so scary in my life. This creature was dark and hairy and was walking on two feet. We have just had the storms from Hurricane Frances pass over this Sunday night and the weather has been terrible. We have alot of trees down and power has been out since Sunday. We are hoping this thing does not come back as we are living in total darkness out here and will not have our power restored any time soon. My son's girlfriend is sending this email to you as we need to let someone know what we have seen. There may have been other neighbors in our area that has seen this but we haven't be able to talk to them as of yet.",
