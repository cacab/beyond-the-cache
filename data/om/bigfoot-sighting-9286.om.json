  "observed": "On Sep 1, 2004 at about 5:30pm I was traveling west on US Hwy 20 about four miles west of the Sherman Pass summit.  As I came around a curve I saw a very large black or very dark brown creature crossing over the guard rail on the right side of the road.  At first I thought it was a bear, but then it stood more upright and jerked it's head around to look at me as I approached.  I'd guess I was about 75 yards away.  The creature creature instantly turned and leaped rear feet first off the edge of the imbankment and was gone.  Two days later a friend who had to go to Spokane stopped at the area and said he saw very large footprints and a place about 20 feet down the bank wher it had landed.  I'm certain it wasn't a bear because the profile and the way it moved wasn't like any bear I've ever seen.  When it stood almost fully erect, I guess he was a little better than four feet above the top of the guard rail.",
