  "observed": "Hello, I am reluctant to place this report; for two reasons, one the siting was from my son when he was about six or seven, and it happened in a populated area. At the time I lived with my grandmother in Menomonee Falls Wisconsin, I had lived here also throughout my life, this is a suburb of Milwaukee. The thing is, behind us was a swamp and around us it was pretty wooded. Through my life strange things would happen by our house; strange bangings on the side of our house, really bad stench (always dismissed as skunks), items being eaten in my grandmothers garden, and walnuts being all over the place. These things could have happened with other animals. My neighbor had a stange event once. Anyway, my grandmothers house was a 100 year old farm house. It had a porch and a couple of large windows facing it, in the inside of this part of the house was a little front room with a couch, then the main living room was on the inside of the house next to this room. My son and I had slept on the first floor because it was so hot upstairs, (my grandmother didn't want air), well my son woke me up and said something strange was looking at him, he was really frightned, so he slept next to me on the floor. Well I was on this website and I showed my son one of your pictures, and he said that is what he saw. I am really not sure if he had seen anything or not, my son is very honest. What I am trying to find out mainly is there other reports in this area? It would explain some things, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. I have been trying to find information about Bigfoot in Wisconsin, your site has been helpful; it just seems odd to have a sighting in Menomonee Falls. There is a heavy deer population there and in the surrounding area, it is heavly wooded. I live in Sussex now, and when I first moved here the local paper had an article about how Bigfoot was seen here in the 1950's. I am just trying to find out if there have been reports in this area. Trying to confirm sons story.",
