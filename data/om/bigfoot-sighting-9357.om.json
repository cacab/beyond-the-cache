  "observed": "My sighting was in May of 2000 on the Tule River Indian Reservation in Porterville CA.  I worked on the reservation at this time at the end of the paved road (very remote), my secretary (who is a member of the tribe) and I stepped outside for a break.  My secretary spotted it first on the mountain behind our office.  She pointed it out to me, it was a large hairy mammal standing in front of a rock about 100 yrds away with it's left arm extended upward holding on to a rock ledge.  It was easy to see and make out the animal's face and eyes.  We watched it for about 10 minuets but then my secretary got scared so we went back into the office.  She then told me that her people believed that the bigfoot was sacred and that they lived at the area we had saw the bigfoot and that they help to carry their dead through this mountain to the other side.  I then went back out side and it was gone.",
