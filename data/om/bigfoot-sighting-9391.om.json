  "observed": "13 Miles south of Glen Avon Bridge on the Molalla River in Oregon, my friend, myself and two large dogs jumped out of my truck to check up on a regular camp site we use throughout the summer. We walked only about 25 ft from the gravel road and a huge sound of bushes/trees crackling and breaking came from our left. I saw the disturbance out of the corner of my eye and when I looked over, I could see the brush moving violently about 10 ft beyond our path. I didn't see any thing but  there was an enormous two or three steps traveling away from us and I could feel the vibration of the weight of the steps under my own feet. That was no deer or elk, the pounding of steps was too heavy and there was a distinct - one step, then a broad second step hitting the ground.  I instantly knew that we had definitely startled something that was very big, very close and very fast. I have heard many human-like steps that seemed excessively heavy on more than one camping trip at the Molalla. They are always after all have gone into their tents or settled in for the night. Usually between midnight and three am.",
