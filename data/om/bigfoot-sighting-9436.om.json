  "observed": "Okay me and my friends were fishing down at the creek by our house and we were tired and decided to leave. So we all started walking back up the road from the wood area and [our friend] said that he had forgotten the bait. So he ran down to the creek to get the bait then he came running back and screaming and said that he saw a giant white hairy thing picking up leaves and droping them. So we were all freaked out.  So like 3 of us went back down there to see what he was talking about and as we were walking along the creek a big hairy white man like thing jumped out from behind a tree in front of us, looked at us then jumped the creek (which is far too wide for the average human to jump) and ran off.",
