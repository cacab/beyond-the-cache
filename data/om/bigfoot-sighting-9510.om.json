  "observed": "I live in the Olympics, and usually in the Spring I hear a high pitch scream in the forest about 600' from my cabin.  It is very scary, makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up, I go into my cabin, and I don't come out- this is mid morning time.  This year I didn't hear the screachy scream in the Spring.  I took my grandchildren for a walk in the woods in search of mushrooms and discovered a hole in the ground with branches over it.....???????????  It wasn't a tool dug hole in the ground, but that of an animal with the fine throwing of the soil.  I didn't think much of it since there was a beer can thrown in it, but still my curiosity was profound.  We left the woods.  Within a week of this happening, 70 ' across the road from my cabin came a very loud whistle, scream, and huge growling noise, all simultaniously, and witnessed by five people.  I have experienced rocks being thrown at my cabin, and the most scary was when I looked across the road a few nights ago and saw whitish blue bright eyes- with no lights shining on them!  Is this a Sasquatch?  It is frightening me very much.  Before this experience my daughter and I had been smelling something like rotten dead animal smell.....and it was coming from under my porch.......when I had the maintenance man look under there....nothing there!...but the smell.  A few days ago my daughter and I smelled the smell of fresh earth dug up two days in a row, but there has been no digging here.  If this is a Sasquatch, why isn't it leaving here and migrating? Any advice you could give me would be appreciated. Thank you,",
