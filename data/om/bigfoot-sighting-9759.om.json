  "observed": "I was living in Southern California at the time, I was 12yrs old, and was invited by my friends family to stay at a cabin with them at Big Bear lake for the weekend. We arrived before noon that Friday unloaded the suburban, and helped my friends dad take down the plywood from the windows before heading off to explore the woods and rock formations around the cabin.  After dinner we were discussing the next days activities and went to bed. The cabin look like in had been there awhile. Sometime during the night I had to go to the bathroom, and I knew the toilet wasn’t working.  I got up walked thru the kitchen and turned on the light before going outside.  I left the door open so the light would shine thru, and I closed the screen door behind me.  I didn’t want to go right there by the door so I walk over to the tree line on the other side of the parking area, and was reaching down to start when I felt really scared. I looked over to my right and about 20ft away something was looking at me over a bush. It was between 2 large trees and standing behind a bush parting the top of the bush with its hands looking right at me. All I could see was the upper chest, head, arms, hands. I stood there looking back for 15-20 seconds, and then I just bolted for the cabin.  I didn’t look back, because I didn’t want to. I ran up the steps and dove thru the screen door landing on the living room floor; I then reached back and slammed the door.  I crawled to the other side of the room next to the couch before my friend’s father came into the room. He walked over to me and asked what was wrong, I looked up at him, and I just lost it!! I was crying and shaking so much I couldn’t speak.  By that time my friend and his mother were there, and she helped calm me down bit. I told them I went outside to go to the bathroom, and something was standing there looking at me, They ask me was it a person, I said no!  It was huge, black and very tall.  His father asked was it a bear, I said no!  Bears don't have hands!  My friends father went and got his flashlight, he then walked over to the door and opened it.  He looked at the screen door and looked back at me, what happened to the screen!  I said I left the door open for some light and jumped thru it when I ran back into the cabin. He looked back at the screen door for a second and then shut the door. My friend’s mother said no one goes outside until morning when it is light out.  We stayed up for awhile maybe an hour or so, before going back to bed. In the morning I showed my friends father where I was standing and the spot were it was standing he look at the ground a little and the area nearby, but found nothing.  He just said it was probably a bear.  I told him it was not a bear its face was flat and the hands had long fingers. He said we should stay close to the cabin the rest of the weekend and not to go wondering around. Nothing else happened the rest of the weekend. The description of the face was very ape-like, and the nose area was different not as pronounced just smaller, with hair all over except the mouth area and eyes.  I didn’t see any eye shine at all, and the head was pointed. The upper chest was massive, very wide and powerful looking. I notice the hands first when I looked over at it that night.  The hands were long with some hair not as much as the rest of it.  I did see a thumb on the left hand when it was parting the top of the bush.  The bush was taller than me at the time I was 5'7”.  I didn’t smell or hear anything. When we got back home my parents were told what happen, and that I was pretty shook up about it, and that I didn't sleep much over the weekend.  I didn’t know what I saw until later when I was in our local Woolworth's looking at state boards, and as I past the magazine racks, there on the cover was a picture of Bigfoot from the Patterson film. I bought the magazine, and I now show it to my friends, and my family.",
