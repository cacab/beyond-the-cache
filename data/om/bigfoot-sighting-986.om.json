  "observed": "Hi, i recently heard a show called coast to coast am during my graveyard shift and decicded maybe its time to tell someone about my sighting years ago while i was hunting,  I grew up in Skamania county washington, thats in the lower cenrtal part of the state, I spent my youth hiking and exploring the woods with my father, i  had heard of bigfoot sightings growing up and remember a story in the skamania county pionner news paper about a deputy shiriff seeing one and them getting a  cast of its foot{might want to look that story up) anyway i didnt believe at all in them cause i had covered alot of dense forest land and never saw anything or heard anything,  my father told me he found a footprint when he was in his twentys  hunting, it was in a patch of snow he said it was kinda old but he said it wasnt anything like hed ever  seen, it was about 18 inches long by maybe 7 to 8 inches wide with toes and a deep impression i still didnt beleive in them,  And like most people some of the crazy stories about ufos and bigfoot in them and and some of the charactors that tell the stories make it easy to make fun of it. So ive never told this story to anyone except one oldtimer who was a trapper who seen them several times.  So heres my story,It was hunting season in the fall of 1982 i was around 21 years old and hunting a area in of eastern skamania county called the nester peak area it has an old fire lookout on top of the highest peak which is no longer in use, its pretty rugged country even though its not all that far away from some small towns.  I had scouted the area several weeks prior to hunting season and saw alot of sign  and tree rubs and about 3 days before opening morning i saw a beautiful 4 point buck checking its rub.   So openin  morning i got in thier about hour before light and waited about half hour after light a heard a loud snap and some loud rustleing in the brush but never saw anything.  the area i was setting at was at the top of a revene or samll draw with road and  mountain behind me and the other side of  the revenes sidehill in front of me with a deep rugged canyon behind that.   after a while i desided to hike over the the other side and see if thier was any fresh sign  as i got toward the top of the other side i heard alot of niose and something going over the hill toward the canyon, i approached slow but never saw anything but thier was this god awful smell in the air ,its hard to explain but it smelled like a  wet old musty dog that had rolled in some cow manure  but really strong and stinky  it was not plesent to say the least i thought maybe it was a bear cause ive smelled bear before but it was just different,the next morning I went to the same place and waited, i heard noise down the revine aways , a few minutes later i saw something walking up the otherside of the hill, thought it was a bear but looked through my scope and was looking at a gorrila type animal, it didnt really look like a gorrila but thats all i could think of it didnt seem real big , i was probably 80 to 100 yards away ,its head was wide and tall its arms were big and they didnt go past its knees ,about like a mans , thick hair on back, top of head and legs  thinner on chest and face i moved, kneeled down behind stump and pickup my binocs,  it heard me and the noise it made was unreal. like a cougars scream but just different and it dropped to the ground like it was hiding. i heard more noise and from the right came another one which was alot bigger, it leaned down by the other one and  it stood up and looked right at me.it was much bigger probably 3 ft taller than the other one , it had alot of hair on its shoulders, hanging down and thick, its face was not that covered and through the binocs i sould see its eyes which were big dark , kinda human like though and a human type nose with large nostrials a mouth that was straight across and i saw its teeth when it opened it mouth they were big and flat not pointed.I could hear it breathing from where i was at. it was loud and deep,it was lighter and if i had to sat what color id say it had dark brown in places and reddish in places it had huge hairy legs i couldnt see its feet much  the littler one stood up and they walked slowly up the hill stopping every 50 ft and looking at me. id say the big one was maybe 7 or 8 ft tall not any taller than 8 and maybe 400 to 500 pounds, not like the storys id heard of 13 ft tall and 1000 pounds they got to to top of the hill and another one came up from the right it was a little shorter than the big one and kinda hard to see, it was probably thier in view i just didnt see it earlier as i was looking at the others they  walked out of sight over the hill into the canyon i just sat thier and was questioning myself what i had just saw, i was scared but just totally amazed , ileft the area and went home , i wished i had a camera so bad but ill always have the vision in my head. i went back thier about three days later and walked over thier where that littler on kneeled down. thier was some hair on a bush about 6 inches long not much an  thier was a few footprints around  i have a size 11 shoe and i put my foot in the biggest one i could find and it was probably 3 inches wider and  5 inches longer that my boot so like maybe 17 inches long and 7 inches wide, thier where some huge 3 foot rocks rolled over and you could see they dug under them, or something had and a couple old rotten logs moved and broke up.  but really not alot of tracks even though i know thier were 3 animals thier and no sign where they went over the bank into the canyon. anyway thats it and i doubt ill ever tell it again, just wanted to let you know thier are real 'SANE' People that have seen. They just dont talk,       THANKS  RM",
